            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO thee alone I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the peruſal of this Journal, which not only my ſelf, but ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judicious Perſons have thought worthy to appear in our Tongue, and amongſt the <hi>Curioſo's</hi> of our Nation. The Author is well known to be a Man of Integrity, and one that ſcorns to impoſe upon the World an untruth; of which, <pb facs="tcp:106091:3"/>in this occaſion, nothing can tempt him to be guilty. If therefore ſome Particulars look with a ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable Countenance, be not ſo unſociable in thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, as to reject whatſoever thou haſt no demonſtration to prove. A ridiculous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and a pernicious Rule, which tends to deprive us of the benefit of many Knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, both in Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Matters. It is unlikely that ſuch a Perſon of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and intereſt in the World, as he is known to be, ſhould ſo much forget his reaſon, as to <pb facs="tcp:106091:3"/>ſubſcribe his Name to ſuch fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoods, as may be eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the place of his ordinary abode. I confeſs ſome Obſervations are trivial and ordinary, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will prove ſatisfactory to ſuch worthy Souls as deſire to know the paſſages of the World, and Foreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This Country of <hi>Egypt</hi> hath heretofore been the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Magazin of Learning, as well as of Proviſions: It hath flouriſhed in all Manual Arts, and the rareſt Sciences. No doubt but that there are yet to be ſeen ſome Monuments <pb facs="tcp:106091:4"/>of the Primitive Grandeur and Learning of the ancient Inhabitants: As therefore
<hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlebius</hi> hath judg'd them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be viſited in his Travels, and afterwards of this account which he gives in Print, I think them not unworthy of thy knowledge; which thou mayeſt perhaps improve in the interpretation of ſome obſcure paſſages of holy Writ, and for other purpoſes according to thy Profeſſion.</p>

               <p>IN the Year 1671. about the 8th of <hi>May,</hi> I was at
<hi>Marſeilles,</hi> with an intention to ſail again into <hi>Egypt:</hi> for that purpoſe I found an opportunity, the Ship the <hi>Three Kings,</hi> Commanded by an Aged Captain named <hi>Artaut,</hi> was ready to depart for
<hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretta.</hi> I went aboard, and ſet ſail from the Port the 20th of the ſame Month, ſtrait towards <hi>Malta,</hi> where we remained five days, and after directed our Courſe to <hi>Lernica,</hi> in the Iſland of
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> Merchants make their abode; on the Sea-ſide, looking towards the <hi>South,</hi> we arrived the 17th of
<hi>June.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as I ſet foot aſhore, I fell deſperately ſick of an ordinary Diſeaſe to all Strangers, proceeding from the Infection of the Air, that is an Enemy to them: But my Diſtemper could not hinder me from going to <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> the chief City of the Iſland. When I felt my Malady in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing every day, and the rather through the <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106091:5"/>dangerous Infection of the Plague which was then in the Iſland, I reſolved to be carried to <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> the neareſt and moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Port where the <hi>French</hi> Nation hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul: Whileſt I was at <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> Captain <hi>Artaut</hi> was departed with his Ship for <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> and the 26th of <hi>June</hi> I went aboard another Ship in the Haven of <hi>Lernica,</hi> and the next day with a favourable Wind we landed at <hi>Tripoli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though I had forſaken the infectious Iſland, the diſeaſe of my body forſook me not, but grew to that paſs, that I prepar'd my ſelf, as Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity injoyns us, to leave the World: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, at the end of 35 days, my diſtemper being weary to torment me, ſuffer'd me to recover a little ſtrength; and though I was but weak, I went aboard a Ship bound for <hi>Alepo</hi> the firſt of <hi>Septemb.</hi> arriv'd the 13th, and abode there four Months.</p>
               <p>About the laſt of <hi>Decemb.</hi> I went to
<hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where I remain'd a Month, and from thence to
<hi>Seyda,</hi> where I was alſo two Months.</p>
               <p>My purpoſe is not to give any account of the Curioſities of
<hi>Lernica,</hi> of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> of
<hi>Alepo,</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and of <hi>Seyda.</hi> Theſe Towns are ſufficiently known to all the World, by the many Relations already publiſhed of the <hi>Levant</hi> Countries: Beſides the ſhortneſs of the time of my abode there, together with the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Quartan Feaver which kept me compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſixteen Months, ſuffered me not to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any ſuch matters. I ſhall therefore in this Treatiſe give an account only of what Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I have ſeen in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where during the ſpace of twenty Months I have had the leiſure and opportunities to take a view of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106091:5"/>things, with the greateſt exactneſs and care imaginable, which hath never been done of this famous and beautiful Country till now.</p>
               <p>The 19th day of <hi>February,</hi> 1672. I took Ship at
<hi>Seyda,</hi> a Town of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> to ſail for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mietta</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but a contrary Wind roſe, and brought us back to
<hi>Seyda</hi> again, where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd till the 16th of <hi>March.</hi> I went then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and met with a favourable Gale, that drove us very happily to <hi>Bogas,</hi> which lies at the Mouth of the River <hi>Nilus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think it convenient, before we proceed, to give a general account and deſcription of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that the things that I ſhall hereafter mention may better be underſtood.</p>

                     <hi>Egypt</hi> is ſcituate in <hi>Africa,</hi> according to the common and ordinary Opinion; nevertheleſs, ſome of the Ancient Geographers have placed it part in <hi>Africa,</hi> and part in
<hi>Aſia,</hi> making the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nilus</hi> as the Bounds between theſe two great parts of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egypt</hi> is bounded on the <hi>South</hi> with
<hi>Nubia,</hi> and the laſt City of <hi>Egypt</hi> is <hi>Iſvan,</hi> called by the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans Siene,</hi> which is commanded by the Bay of
<hi>Girge;</hi> on the <hi>Weſt</hi> it hath the Provinces of <hi>Vah,</hi> and <hi>Barca;</hi> and on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> are the <hi>Deſarts</hi> that divide it from <hi>Paleſtina;</hi> and on the <hi>North</hi> is part of the
<hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <p>It ſtretcheth it ſelf in length from the City of
<hi>Iſvan</hi> to the Mouth of the River <hi>Nilus;</hi> at
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetta,</hi> in a ſtreight line, that is from <hi>South</hi> to
<hi>North</hi> about five hundred and threeſcore miles: it is not poſſible to declare it preciſely, becauſe they are not wont to meaſure the Country by Miles, or by Leagues, but by the Camels Journeys only. I ſay here nothing, but according to the Relation of the Authors that have examin'd it.</p>
                  <p>It is divided, according to the accounts of the <hi>Divan,</hi> or Treaſury, into three parts: 1. Into <hi>Said,</hi> or the Upper
<hi>Egypt,</hi> which begins at <hi>Sint,</hi> and extends as far as
<hi>Iſvan.</hi> 2. Into <hi>Voſtani,</hi> or the middle <hi>Egypt,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Said</hi> and <hi>Cairo:</hi> And 3. Into <hi>Bahri,</hi> or Inferiour <hi>Egypt.</hi> The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle begins at <hi>Gize,</hi> a Village over againſt <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac,</hi> and reaches as far as <hi>Momfallon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and the lower commenceth at <hi>Cairo,</hi> and includes <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and <hi>Damietta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Upper <hi>Egypt,</hi> or that part of it which is habitable and uſeful, is very narrow. In the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt part, a Horſe in four hours may paſs over it; <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106091:7"/>in ſome places it is not above three hours riding: and the Country in both ſides is wild, ſandy, and hilly.</p>
                  <p>I cannot give an exact account of its wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the middle, but yet I am perſwaded it is not much larger nor wider than the higher part; for being ſcituated between both, <hi>Egypt</hi> begins to grow wider about
<hi>Cairo;</hi> it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the middle is not much wider than the upper part, unleſs it be about the <hi>Caſcieflik</hi> of
<hi>Fiúm,</hi> where <hi>Egypt</hi> in the middle begins to be wider; but yet I cannot give any exact account of it.</p>
                  <p>The Inferiour part is wider: The Inhabitants reckon about 70 miles from <hi>Damietta</hi> to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> the moſt Weſtern-Town upon the Sea-Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>A Learned Perſon of this Age, in a diſcourſe concerning the cauſes of the Inundation of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> hath very well proved againſt the Ancient Philoſophers, that the lower <hi>Egypt</hi> hath always been, and is not a new gift of <hi>Nilus.</hi> He grounds his Opinion firſt upon <hi>Homerus,</hi> who mentions the old City of <hi>Canopus,</hi> which was at one of the chief entrances into <hi>Nilus</hi> from the Sea. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, upon the teſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 77. who have mentioned the City of <hi>Tanis,</hi> where was <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, and where God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed great Wonders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egypt</hi> was always governed by Kings, but the Royal Seats have not always continued the ſame, for the Conquerours have altered them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Royal City, as <hi>Macriſi</hi> ſaith, was
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> but the Waters of the Deluge having rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106091:7"/>it, the Poſterity of <hi>Noah</hi> built <hi>Menuf,</hi> or
<hi>Memphis,</hi> which was the Seat of the Ancient Kings of the Race of
<hi>Coptus,</hi> till <hi>Nabuchodonozor</hi> had ſack'd it. When
<hi>Alexander the Great</hi> had built <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he made it the Principal City, where all the ſucceeding Kings of the <hi>Greeks</hi> made their Reſidence for nine hundred years, till the <hi>Arabians</hi> had taken
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and made <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat</hi> Metropolis. But when
<hi>Giauher,</hi> the General of <hi>Meez le Din-alla</hi> had built
<hi>Cairo,</hi> about the year of the <hi>Hegeira</hi> 362. he called it
<hi>Dar il Memleke,</hi> that is the Royal Seat, which it hath been ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egypt</hi> hath been govern'd by three ſeveral ſorts of
<hi>Mahumetan</hi> Princes, ſince the <hi>Arabians</hi> took it from the
<hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt were named <hi>Omara Maſſr,</hi> or Lords of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> without any other Title. They were all <hi>Arabians,</hi> and Succeſſors of <hi>Amru ibn il Aſs,</hi> who was the firſt Conquerour, and after to <hi>Abu il Fevares,</hi> the laſt of that Race. We reckon one hundred and twelve Princes of <hi>Egypt,</hi> during the ſpace of 337 Years, ſeven Months, and twenty Days. Their Conqueſt happen'd about twenty years after the <hi>Hegeira,</hi> and ended in the year 358. They all dwelt at
<hi>Foſtat Maſſer,</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Race of the <hi>Arabians</hi> were called
<hi>Caliphs.</hi> They began to take that Title, when Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Abuhaſſein Giauher</hi> had built <hi>Cairo</hi> by the Order of
<hi>Meez le Din-alba,</hi> who was then Prince of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and Conquer'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> and took it from the <hi>Arabians. Egypt</hi> was afterwards go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by its <hi>Caliphs</hi> about 108 Years, 4 Months, and 22 Days; that is, to the death of <hi>Adet le <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106091:8"/>Din-alla,</hi> who was the laſt and Eleventh <hi>Caliph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third ſort, named <hi>Sultans</hi> or <hi>Soldans,</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded immediately after; of them there have been of four Nations.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, who was the Poſterity of a certain
<hi>Eijub,</hi> were called <hi>Sultans Curdes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond came from beyond the Seas, &amp; were named
<hi>Mamaluk Turks,</hi> becauſe they had been before Slaves, and ſold by the Merchants of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> to the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who cauſed them to be brought up and inſtructed in all Martial Diſcipline. When the King was dead, one of theſe Slaves was choſen to ſucceed in the Throne.</p>
                  <p>The third ſort were ſtiled <hi>Mamaluks Circaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> becauſe they came originally from
<hi>Circaſſia,</hi> and were brought thither by the Merchants as the former, and ſold alſo as Slaves to the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who cauſed them to be alſo train'd up as the former, unto whom they ſucceeded in the Regal Dignity and Command.</p>
                  <p>The fourth ſort, who are now in poſſeſſion, are the
<hi>Sultans</hi> of the Race of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the
<hi>Circaſſian Sultans</hi> in the year 922. of the <hi>Hegeira;</hi> for
<hi>Sultan Selim</hi> Conquer'd this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the year 1517.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egypt</hi> is inhabited at preſent by <hi>Copties, Moors, Arabians, Turks, Greeks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Franks,</hi> and other ſtrange Nations; but as they are not nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, they deſerve not to be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> or <hi>Copts</hi> are the Natural Inhabitants of the Country, thus called, as we have already ſaid, of
<hi>Coptus</hi> the Son of <hi>Miſraim,</hi> who was King of <hi>Egypt</hi> after his Father.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moors,</hi> who are named by the <hi>Arabians Aulad il Arab,</hi> or Children of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> are <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106091:8"/>likewiſe as well as the <hi>Copties</hi> deſcended from the ſame Father, but they are become <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and it may be ſince they have Conquered <hi>Egypt,</hi> there are ſome amongſt them yet that are come from the <hi>Arabians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> are a people of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and though they live in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they have no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the
<hi>Moors,</hi> who are originally of the Country. They are of many differing Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, govern'd by their ſeveral Chieftains, whom I ſhall mention in the ſequel of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have eſtabliſh'd themſelves there ſince <hi>Sultan Selimus</hi> conquer'd <hi>Egypt.</hi> Theſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Country, defend it, and act in all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of State.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> that live there now, and that make yet profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, have been invited thither by the great Trade of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> for there is no ſign of the Ancient
<hi>Greeks,</hi> who eſtabliſh'd themſelves there when <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great</hi> conquer'd <hi>Egypt;</hi> if there be any, they are mingled with the
<hi>Copties,</hi> and are called by their names.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Emperours that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Council of <hi>Chalcedonia</hi> were glad to incourage a Party in
<hi>Egypt</hi> againſt the <hi>Copties,</hi> ſworn Enemies of that Council, they protected there the <hi>Greeks</hi> that went thither from
<hi>Greece,</hi> that ſubmitted to that Council, and gave them means to eſtabliſh themſelves in this Kingdom; ſince that time the
<hi>Greekiſh</hi> Religion hath been there profeſſed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> have always lived there; at preſent they are very numerous, and are in great repute, <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106091:9"/>chiefly at
<hi>Cairo,</hi> and in the Maritime Towns: but unleſs it be in ſuch places there are none to be found, for if their occaſions call them into the Country, they uſually diſguiſe and hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for when the Country-people find them out, they abuſe and affront them ſtrangely.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> at preſent in <hi>Egypt</hi> are not nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, in compariſon of what they have been heretofore; for in the days of <hi>Amru ibn il Aſſ,</hi> who took this Country from the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> there was of this Nation ſix hundred thouſand that paid him Tribute: but now, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their own Patriarch, there is ſcarce ten or fifteen thouſand. One of the Cauſes of this decreaſe, was their conſtancy in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, in the time of the
<hi>Romans;</hi> their Governours were ſo furious againſt them for that reaſon, that they have put to death milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at a time: for the Hiſtories tell us of the Governour under <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the Emperour, who maſſacred in one night, at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> fourſcore thouſand; who are buried upon Mount <hi>Achmim</hi> in the Upper <hi>Egypt.</hi> And at another time near <hi>Iſna,</hi> either the ſame Governour, or another, put to death ſo many that they were not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, for they covered fourſcore <hi>Fiddans,</hi> or Furlongs, with their dead martyr'd bodies: The
<hi>Fiddan</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> contains 400 Caſſabs or Yards, every Yard is 6 Cubits.</p>
                  <p>Another Cauſe of their decreaſe in the days of the Chriſtian Emperours, was their obſtinacy in maintaining the Errour of
<hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> one of their Patriarchs, concerning one Nature, one Will, and Perſon in Jeſus Chriſt, which cauſed them to ſuffer almoſt the ſame deſtructions as <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106091:9"/>they had done formerly under the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours for the Chriſtian Faith: For when the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours offered to force them to leave the Errour of <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> and to embrace the Faith eſtabliſhed in the Council of <hi>Chalcedone,</hi> and when they found them diſobedient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible; they made uſe of the Sword to compaſs their deſign. Amongſt the reſt the Emperour
<hi>Juſtinian,</hi> as <hi>Macriz</hi> ſaith in his Hiſtory of the Patriarchs, cauſed two hundred thouſand <hi>Copties</hi> to be killed at
<hi>Alexandria</hi> for that very purpoſe. I ſhall not mention the Cruelties of the other Emperours his Succeſſors exerciſed upon them. So that ſuch as ſurvived after ſuch like Maſſacres, when they ſaw the danger that attended the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this Opinion, and of appearing in the Cities, they retreated into the wilderneſs, or withdrew themſelves into the Monaſteries, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, to lead a Monaſtical life, without marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or thinking to propagate their Nation.</p>
                  <p>After this, the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kings and Princes, that have governed <hi>Egypt</hi> ſince the Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, when they found them rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Government, have not ſpared them. They have killed the Chief, ſold for Slaves the Wives and Children of others, ſo that the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſort have been forc'd to turn <hi>Mahometans.</hi> By this means, after ſo many evils, this Nation is reduced to a very ſmall number.</p>
                  <p>They were anciently Heathens, every City had a God to adore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abuſir,</hi> or the old <hi>Buſiris,</hi> worſhipped a Calf. <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the ancient <hi>Racotis,</hi> adored
<hi>Serapis</hi> of Stone. <hi>Achmim,</hi> which is the old <hi>Panos,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>Apollo. Bana</hi> worſhipped a Dog. <hi>Baſſa,</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106091:10"/>or the old <hi>Bubaſtis,</hi> had for God a Lion of Stone. <hi>Eida</hi> adored <hi>Serapis. Iſchemunein,</hi> which is the ancient <hi>Hermopolis,</hi> worſhipped a Man of Stone. <hi>Iſvan,</hi> called by the <hi>Copties Sevan,</hi> reverenced the Tree <hi>Lebaca. Cous</hi> worſhipped the Moon and Stars. <hi>Mindadi</hi> the Fig-tree of <hi>Pharaoh. Memphis</hi> a Calf. <hi>Atrib,</hi> or the old <hi>Atribis,</hi> ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Calf of Stone. <hi>Semennut,</hi> which is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Sebennis,</hi> worſhipped a Calf of Braſs. <hi>Sa</hi> a Hog of Stone. <hi>Tuba</hi> had a reſpect for the Water and all that is therein. I have taken all theſe particulars out of an old Manuſcript in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick, that I have ſeen in the Monaſtry of S. <hi>Anthony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſince the coming of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they have been ſome of the firſt that have embraced the Chriſtian Religion, at the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Mark.</hi> They have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the right Faith, till <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch fell into this Hereſie, That in Jeſus Chriſt there was but one Nature, one Subſtance, one Will, and one Operation. This Errour with its Author was condemned in the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedone,</hi> and ſuch as receive it are counted as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore they have been perſecuted by the Chriſtian Emperours in times paſt.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I treat more amply of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Eccleſiaſtical Ceremonies in another Book named the Church of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> which I compoſed for that purpoſe when I was at
<hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> therefore I will ſay no more at preſent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> have often changed their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The firſt and ancient Language of the Country was that of the <hi>Copties,</hi> which was uſed <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106091:10"/>all the time that their Kings reigned in
<hi>Egypt.</hi> But when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had ſubdued that Country, they were forced to learn the Speech of their Conquerour, which was the Greek, ſince commonly ſpoken in <hi>Egypt</hi> above nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, till the <hi>Arabians</hi> had driven away the <hi>Greeks.</hi> They brought in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue, which is now commonly uſed.</p>

                     <hi>Giafer ibn Daleb,</hi> an Arabian Hiſtorian, ſaith, that it is twelve days journey long, as they march with Camels in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but it is not above four Hours travelling from ſide to ſide in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that is inhabited: for if we ſhould compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in the breadth the Mountains of Sand on the Eaſt and Weſt, it is a great deal broader than we have ſaid.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Iſvan</hi> is the fartheſt Confine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South, which is in the <hi>Caſcieflick</hi> of <hi>Ibrîm.</hi> On the Eaſt it ſtretcheth forth as far as the <hi>Red-ſea,</hi> and on the Weſt as far as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Vah.</hi>

                  <p>The Chief City heretofore was <hi>Hú,</hi> whereof I ſhall ſpeak hereafter more at large; but now the Capital City is
<hi>Girge,</hi> where lives the <hi>Sangiac-Bey</hi> that governs it.</p>
                  <p>Anciently certain Princes ruled here in the time of the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> called in their Language <hi>Omara Said.</hi> They dwelt then at <hi>Hú,</hi> which is, the old <hi>Dioſpolis,</hi> ſurnamed the Upper, diſtant from <hi>Girgé</hi> about a days journey, and on the ſame ſide of the River <hi>Nilus</hi> as we go up: But when
<hi>Girgé</hi> was inlarg'd by time, and <hi>Hú</hi> fell to decay, the Princes of <hi>Said</hi> ſettled their abode at
<hi>Girgé,</hi> which hath been always the Chief City ſince that time till now.</p>
                  <p>About fifty years ago the <hi>Turks</hi> drove away from thence thoſe <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes, and in their ſtead they put the
<hi>Sangiac-Beys,</hi> who are Natural <hi>Turks;</hi> the firſt was named
<hi>Soliman-Gianballat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This puts me in mind of a miſtake of <hi>James Albertus</hi> in his diſcourſe of <hi>Egypt;</hi> he ſaith, that <hi>Said</hi> was about 60 years ago a Kingdom of it ſelf, to which the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> did uſually aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign a <hi>Pacha.</hi> This Errour hath no ground: Firſt, becauſe in all the Hiſtories, ancient and new, of the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> the Province of <hi>Said</hi> is never nam'd
<hi>Memleke</hi> a Kingdom, nor <hi>Pachalick</hi> the Government of a
<hi>Pacha,</hi> but only <hi>Arde Said, i. e.</hi> the Country of
<hi>Said;</hi> and its Rulers, were not nam'd Kings, or <hi>Pachas,</hi> but only <hi>Omara Said,</hi> or Princes of <hi>Said.</hi> Secondly, becauſe all the Governours of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Race, who have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd it ſince the driving out of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes, are never call'd in the Regiſters of the <hi>Divan,</hi> nor of the common people, otherwiſe than
<hi>Sangiac-Beys,</hi> two only excepted, who were <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106091:11"/>named
<hi>Pachas,</hi> becauſe they had been <hi>Pachas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were the Governours of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and though they did bear this Title, they were always ſubject to the <hi>Pachas</hi> of <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is certain, the Province of <hi>Said</hi> is very large; and if it were all inhabited, and all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nur'd, as is the lower <hi>Egypt,</hi> its
<hi>Bey</hi> might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the <hi>Pacha</hi> of <hi>Cairo</hi> for pre-eminence. They have often endeavour'd to free themſelves from his Command, but becauſe the inhabited Country is very narrow, and the Villages and Towns ruinated, they could never ſucceed in their deſign.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the Government is much like that of the
<hi>Pachas</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> for he hath the ſame Officers to attend him, a <hi>Chiaoux-Bachi,</hi> or a Captain of the <hi>Chiaoux,</hi> an Interpreter, an <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and other
<hi>Aga</hi>'s of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Orders, named in their Language
<hi>Boulouks,</hi> who are taken out of the Souldiery of <hi>Cairo,</hi> and are paid out of the Reverſions of the <hi>Divan.</hi> He hath likewiſe his
<hi>Divan Catebi,</hi> or <hi>Chancellour;</hi> and in truth, he hath all the Priviledges of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> but he hath not the Title, nor the Quality, nor ever had.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Bey</hi> gives to the <hi>Pacha</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> as <hi>James Albertus</hi> ſaith, forty Purſes every year; beſides, he ſends him fifty Horſes, fifty Mules, and one hundred Camels. He gives alſo ten Purſes to his <hi>Kehaja,</hi> and his <hi>Aga:</hi> And for the Tax of his Country, he pays to the <hi>Divan</hi> of <hi>Cairo</hi> one hundred and fifty <hi>Ardebs</hi> of Wheat; and when he gives other Grain, he delivers one <hi>Ardeb</hi> and a half, inſtead of one <hi>Ardeb</hi> of Wheat; and beſides, he ſends four hundred and fourſcore <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106091:12"/>Purſes, each Purſe containing five hundred Crowns: And when he is in the laſt year of his Government, he is bound to cauſe all the Lands of his Government to be ſown which the River hath watered, and for his Expences the <hi>Divan</hi> gives him an Allowance.</p>

                  <p>IN regard the word <hi>Caſcief</hi> is often repeated in this Treatiſe, I have thought it needful, before I proceed any farther in the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to mention its Origine, and the number and imployment of the <hi>Caſciefs:</hi> By this means we ſhall ſee that all <hi>Egypt</hi> is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into little Provinces, or Governments.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Caſcief</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bik Jickscif,</hi> which ſignifies to diſcover a thing; becauſe their Ancient Office was to viſit their Province and Juriſdiction, to find out the

                  <p>In the upper <hi>Egypt</hi> are twenty four, namely of

                  <p>When the Governours are gone out of their <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106091:13"/>Towns, there is no aſſurance for a Traveller, for the

                  <p>This is the Tax that was commonly paid in the year 1634. as

                  <p>The <hi>Caſcief</hi> of <hi>Beheire</hi> pays to the

                  <p>The <hi>Caſcief</hi> of <hi>Manſoura,</hi> as <hi>James Albertus</hi> ſaith, gives to the <hi>Pacha</hi> five and twenty Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, four to his <hi>Kehaja</hi> and <hi>Agas,</hi> and to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> two hundred fourſcore and ſixteen. The <hi>Divan</hi> entertains a hundred Souldiers in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and keeps as many more.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Caſcief</hi> of <hi>Keliub,</hi> which was the old
<hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liope,</hi> ſcituated on the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of the River
<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> as <hi>Cairo,</hi> pays to the <hi>Pacha</hi> five and twenty Purſes, four to his <hi>Kehaja</hi> and <hi>Agas,</hi> and to the
<hi>Divan</hi> two hundred fourſcore and ſixteen. The <hi>Divan</hi> keeps for him, as for the former, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Caſcief</hi> receives the <hi>Coftan,</hi> or his Commiſſion from the <hi>Pacha,</hi> he ſpends about five hundred Crowns.

                  <p>The cold ſeaſon, which is anſwerable to our
<hi>Winter,</hi> begins about the middle of <hi>December:</hi> It is a delightful time, unleſs in the ſeven days which the Arabians call <hi>Berd il agiuz,</hi> or the cold of the old Hag; they begin about the 7th of
<hi>February,</hi> and continue till the 14th; the Mornings are then very cold, the Sky is cloudy, the Rains fall, and the Winds are commonly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry boiſterous.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>Winter</hi> is there very mild, perſons of Eſtate wear Furr'd Gowns, from the Month of <hi>November,</hi> till the Month of <hi>March,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of any great cold, for there is ſcarce any, but becauſe then the Weather is variable, and they fear to be incommoded with the diſtempers which this changeable weather produceth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Summer</hi> is the worſt and moſt troubleſom ſeaſon, becauſe of the exceſſive heats of the hot Winds, and the dangerous diſeaſes that are rife, chiefly at that time, which the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> call <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins,</hi> which we name <hi>Eaſter.</hi> This dangerous ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon begins about the <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Monday of the
<hi>Copties,</hi> and ends at their <hi>Whitſon</hi>-Monday. About this time the Winds, called by the <hi>Arabians Meriſſi,</hi> are boiſterous; they are ſo hot and troubleſome, that they are ready to ſtifle the breath, and they raiſe in the Air ſo much Straw and Sand, that the Sky is darkned. This Sand is ſo ſubtil, that it penetrates through every little chink and hole.</p>

                  <p>About this time Malignant Fevers commonly reign, Dyſenteries, and many other Diſeaſes; the leaſt is incurable, if the neceſſary Remedies be not applied in time: And when theſe winds blow, the bodies that are not diſtemper'd, are caſt down, and not well.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Southerly winds blow not every day in this ſeaſon, nor every year in the ſame manner and fury; for in the year 1672. they blew but twelve times, and the next year but twice, and that very moderately; other freſher and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer winds blew the reſt of the time. It is not poſſible to expreſs the joy of the people, when theſe Southerly winds favour them, and are mild.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary time of Rains and Winds, which might be compared with our <hi>Autumn,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> and continues till <hi>January,</hi> and <hi>February;</hi> though at
<hi>Roſetta,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Rains fall at other times, becauſe of the Seas that are ſo near. At the Eve of the
<hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> in the year 1672. the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was full of Rain at
<hi>Roſetta,</hi> and the next day followed a very thick Miſt. On the 24th day of <hi>November,</hi> in the ſame year, the Rains fell ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moderately at <hi>Cairo;</hi> the Sky was obſcure, and full of wind; and on the tenth, eleventh, fourteenth and fifteenth in the ſame Month, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry furious Rains fell. By this you may ſee, that it is a great errour to ſay, that it never Rains in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have often ſeen in my Travels, that the weather hath been ſo miſty and moiſt, that my Beard and Cloaths have been ſo wet, that a ſhowre of Rain could not have wetted them more; and that which is wonderful is, that this <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106091:16"/>happened in a ſeaſon that none ever expected it. During ſeveral mornings in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> in the year 1672. in my travelling from <hi>Damiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> to <hi>Cairo,</hi> the ſame thing happen'd to me in the Month of <hi>June</hi> at
<hi>Roſetta;</hi> and in the Month of <hi>September</hi> at

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe wet Miſts are more frequent about <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> than in other places. They begin uſually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Month of
<hi>November,</hi> before the riſing of the Sun, and continue all the
<hi>Winter.</hi> Some happen in other ſeaſons of the year, and many times in <hi>Summer,</hi> as I have taken notice in the year 1672. in the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back from <hi>Fium</hi> to
<hi>Mocanan,</hi> a Village about four hours travelling from <hi>Cairo,</hi> I ſaw upon the Town ſo thick a Miſt, that I could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, nor the <hi>Pyramids</hi> that are near, though the Air was clear where I ſtood.</p>
                  <p>In all the ſeaſons of the year, when the nights are ſerene, there is ſo much Dew that falls, that it may very well be taken for a little ſhowre; but when the Sky is cloudy, there falls no Dew. Were it not for theſe Dews, there would be no Graſs nor Corn, the Trees would bear no Fruit, the wild Beaſts in the Deſarts could not live where there are no Fountains nor Rivers, and where the Rains fall but ſeldom. Thunders are not often heard; in all the time that I was in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> I heard this noiſe but twice, on the firſt day of <hi>January,</hi> and on the fourth of
<hi>May,</hi> 1673.</p>
                  <p>I have already ſpoken of the two chief Winds that blow in
<hi>Egypt, Meriſſi</hi> and <hi>Maltem.</hi> I muſt further take notice, that not only the <hi>Southern</hi> Winds are named <hi>Meriſſi,</hi> but alſo the Eaſtern. <pb n="25" facs="tcp:106091:16"/>They blow commonly twice every year; at <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> called (as I have already ſaid) <hi>Camſin;</hi> and from the Month of <hi>November,</hi> till the middle of <hi>February.</hi> They are helpful to thoſe that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel down the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> and to the Ships that ſail from the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> through the Red-Sea to <hi>Sues:</hi> But they are contrary to thoſe that go up the River: From hence it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that Travellers are 30 days going up from <hi>Cairo</hi> to <hi>Girge,</hi> which Voyage is eaſily perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 8 or 10 days when the other winds blow.</p>
                  <p>The Winds called <hi>Maltem</hi> or <hi>Teijáb</hi> are Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly Winds: They begin about twelve days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rain falls, and laſt till the Month of <hi>November;</hi> during that time ſcarce any other Wind blows. The Winds called <hi>Meriſſi</hi> are hot, they ſpoil the Corn, and are hurtful to every thing; but theſe nouriſh and refreſh, not only the Corn, but are comfortable to Man and Beaſt, for they are cooling, and give ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>They ſtop the Mouth of the River, and cauſe the Waves to ſend back the water of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which makes it to ſtop and ſwell over the Banks to water the Earth, and fill all the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels with water. In their ſeaſons they begin to blow about Noon, and continue till midnight; but between midnight, and the Noon of the next day, they ſeldom blow, or very faintly.</p>

                  <p>Father <hi>Telles,</hi> a Jeſuite, ſaith in his Hiſtory of
<hi>Ethiopia,</hi> printed at <hi>Lisbon, That in the Kingdom of</hi> Gojam,
<hi>which is about</hi> 12 <hi>Degrees from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial towards the Weſt, and in the Province of</hi> Saca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hala, <hi>inhabited by the</hi> Agaus
<hi>in a Field of no great extent, incompaſſed about with many high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, there is a little Lake over which one may caſt a ſtone, full of Buſhes and low Trees, whereof the Roots are ſo thick and intangled, that in Summer one may walk upon them. In the middle of this Lake are two great and deep Fountains very near together; from hence iſſues out a clear water that runs under theſe Buſhes and low Trees in two ſeveral Channels: towards the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>and about the diſtance of a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot, they turn to the</hi> North; <hi>about half a mile from thence there appears a great deal of water, and a conſiderable River, into which runs many other ſtreams; and about</hi> 15 <hi>miles from thence, it receives <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106091:18"/>another bigger water, called</hi> Gema, <hi>which loſeth then its name: a little farther, turning towards the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>it receives alſo two other conſiderable ſtreams, called</hi> Kelti <hi>and</hi> Branti; <hi>near this place is the firſt fall of the River: Not much farther, in running towards the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>it enters into the Lake of the</hi> Abyſſins,
<hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> Bahr Dembea, <hi>or the Sea of</hi> Dembea: <hi>when it is paſt through, without mingling its waters with the waters of the Lake, it receives many other Rivers very great; and namely, the River</hi> Tekeze
<hi>near</hi> Egypt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As ſoon as</hi> Nilus <hi>is out of the Lake</hi> Dembea,
<hi>it turns to the</hi> South-Eaſt, <hi>leaving at the left hand the Kingdoms of</hi> Beg-amidr, <hi>of</hi> Amhara, <hi>of</hi> Vole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;
<hi>afterwards running to the</hi> South, <hi>it hath upon the</hi> South-Eaſt <hi>the Kingdom of</hi> Sauva; <hi>afterwards turning again to the</hi> Eaſt-North-Eaſt, <hi>it hath on the</hi> South-<hi>ſide</hi> Ganz, Gafata, <hi>and</hi> Bizamo, <hi>and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through the Countries of</hi> Gonga <hi>and</hi> Gafre, <hi>and a little farther by</hi> Faſcalo,
<hi>then it enters into the Country of</hi> Funch, <hi>or</hi> Nubia, <hi>and from thence runs into</hi> Egypt, <hi>as Father</hi> Telles
<hi>affirms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt conſider beſides, that when <hi>Nilus</hi> is fallen down the laſt Cataract near <hi>Iſvan,</hi> it runs from the
<hi>South</hi> to the <hi>North</hi> very ſlowly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it ſelf below <hi>Boulac</hi> into two great Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the one meets the Sea at
<hi>Roſetta,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Damietta.</hi> This latter divides it ſelf into another Current at <hi>Sciobret il yemen,</hi> a Village ſcituate on the <hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> about half-way between
<hi>Cairo</hi> and <hi>Damietta,</hi> which runs into the Sea at
<hi>Brullos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe three branches, there is a fourth which is artificial, and full of water; but about thirty days of the year, it begins at a Village <pb n="29" facs="tcp:106091:18"/>called <hi>Latf,</hi> on the
<hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> in going to <hi>Roſetta,</hi> about thirty miles from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where the waters of this Current run into the Sea; therefore the <hi>Egyptians</hi> reckon it amongſt the true Mouths of the River <hi>Nilus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not whether beſides theſe four there be any other, as
<hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> affirm, for they reckon about ſeven. But <hi>Egypt</hi> is much alter'd; ſo that there is no appearance nor remembrance of the ſeven Cities where they were, as they ſay.</p>
                  <p>When I was at <hi>Roſetta,</hi> I enquir'd from the Inhabitants concerning this particular, but they could not give me any account, but only of theſe four. Some told me, that beſides the great Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent at
<hi>Damietta,</hi> there was another artificial Channel at <hi>Gaza,</hi> where the waters did run into the Sea, but I cannot believe it: but if this were true, <hi>Gaza</hi> is not in <hi>Egypt;</hi> therefore it cannot be one of the ſeven Mouths of the River <hi>Nilus</hi> ſpoken of by the Ancient Geographers. I could wiſh that ſome other curious Traveller would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them out, and tell us the truth.</p>
                  <p>This is remarkable of <hi>Nilus:</hi> 1. That it begins to increaſe and decreaſe on a certain day preciſely. 2. That when it firſt increaſeth it grows green. 3. That afterwards it appears red; and 4. That it changeth its Channel ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>The day in which it begins to increaſe is year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the 12th of
<hi>June</hi> of the <hi>Copties,</hi> or the 17th day of our <hi>June,</hi> on which day they obſerve the Feaſt of S. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, on which day the drops fall. Now theſe drops are nothing elſe, according to the judgment of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, but the Mercies and Bleſſings of God:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106091:19"/>They believe on that day God ſends the Arch-Angel S.
<hi>Michael</hi> to cauſe the River to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. This is the common Opinion of the people: But the Learned ſay, that theſe drops is a kind of a Dew which falls towards the laſt quarter of the night, near the morning; and which cauſeth the River to be fruitful, purifies the Air from all the infection of <hi>Cumſin,</hi> and gives ſtrength and vertue to all things upon which it falls.</p>
                  <p>Theſe drops are doubtleſs the only cauſe of the fruitfulneſs of <hi>Nilus:</hi> this is eaſily ſeen; for as ſoon as this Dew is fallen, the water begins to be corrupt, and to be of a greeniſh colour; this colour increaſeth more and more, till the River appears as a Lake cover'd all over with Moſs.</p>
                  <p>This colour is to be ſeen not only in its great Channel, but alſo in all the Ponds and Branches that come from thence, only the Ciſterns keep the water pure.</p>
                  <p>Some years this green colour continues about 20 days, and ſometimes more, but never above 40. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> call this time, when the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is green, <hi>il chad raviat,</hi> for they ſuffer much, becauſe the water is corrupt, without taſte, and unwholeſome, and that good water is very rare.</p>
                  <p>Theſe drops or Dew purifies the Air, for as ſoon as it falls, the Plague ceaſeth to be mortal, none dies of it; the Air is wholeſome, all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers ceaſe, and if any perſon grows ſick, he never dies.</p>
                  <p>This Dew gives life to every thing; and when it falls upon the Wheat, it cauſeth it to continue many years without corruption, or worms, and is far more nouriſhing than that Corn upon which it never falls; For this cauſe they never <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106091:19"/>houſe the Corn of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> in the Barns, till this Dew is fallen upon it, that it might keep the longer without worms.</p>
                  <p>The increaſe of the River proceeds from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral cauſes; the firſt and the chief is, the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation cauſed in it by this Dew, which falls at the time mentioned before.</p>
                  <p>The continual Rains of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> that come in <hi>July, Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> which is the Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter of that Country, and the great Torrents of water that run down from the Mountains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rivers that flow into <hi>Nilus,</hi> may be look'd upon as another cauſe of this increaſe, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive that the fermentation can continue
100 days, and cauſe it alone to increaſe ſo much as it is wont.</p>
                  <p>The third cauſe, in my judgment, are the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly winds, called <hi>Maeſtrals,</hi> and by the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians Maltem,</hi> which begin to blow, as I have ſaid, about 12 days before the Dew falls; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the fifth day of <hi>June,</hi> and continue after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards about four Months without alteration. They blow ſtrait into the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the freſh water from coming out, ſo that it returns back, and cauſeth the River to ſwell.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſame Winds have cauſed ſeveral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and namely Monſieur <hi>Burattini</hi> to affirm, that the River obſerves not a preciſe day to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, but that it happens ſome years ſooner, others later; becauſe before the 17th day of <hi>June,</hi> the water did ſeem to ſwell; but this is no real increaſe, the winds <hi>Maeſtrals</hi> are the cauſes of this appearance.</p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> aſcrib'd the cauſe of the ſwelling of <hi>Nilus</hi> to a ſuperſtitious cuſtom.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106091:20"/>They bought a young Damoſel, adorned her with rich attire, and afterward caſt her as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice into the River, on the 12th day of their <hi>Baony,</hi> or <hi>June:</hi> But when <hi>Amru-ibn il aſſ</hi> had conquer'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> and taken it from the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> he aboliſh'd this damnable Cuſtom; which was obſerved in that time, as <hi>Gaznevi</hi> a famous <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Hiſtorian ſaith.
<hi>Amru</hi> commanded the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> to forbear and leave that act of cruelty; in that year it happen'd that the River did not increaſe, which caus'd the people to ſuſpect and fear a great Famine, inſomuch that they reſolved to depart out of the Kingdom. This cauſed <hi>Amru ibn il aſſ</hi> to write to <hi>Amru ibn il Chottab,</hi> a <hi>Califf</hi> of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> to deſire his advice. This <hi>Califf</hi> ſent him a Letter written with his own hand for the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> commanding him to read it, and to caſt it into the water; which as ſoon as <hi>Amru</hi> had performed, the waters roſe 16 Cubits in one night, the 14th of
<hi>September,</hi> which is commonly the laſt day of its increaſe. This was ſufficient to water the Country, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the people.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Country that are ignorant of the true cauſes of this increaſe, imagine that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a large Pond in
<hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in the River it ſelf, which the <hi>Abyſſins</hi> begin to open about the 12th of <hi>June,</hi> and by degrees let out the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more and more, till the 14th of <hi>September,</hi> at which time they begin to ſhut it again; but this is a fooliſh fancy of the
<hi>Copties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the green colour is gone, the River <hi>Nilus</hi> begins to become red, and very muddy; 'tis then no doubt but the fermentation is paſs'd, and that the waters of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> are arriv'd in
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> 
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:106091:20"/>which are of that colour, becauſe of the red Earth which the furious torrents from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains carry into the River; for it is not poſſible that the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is very black, ſhould give it that colour. In the year 1673. in the beginning of
<hi>July,</hi> the water began to be red, which continued till the end of
<hi>December,</hi> the time that the River returns to its ordinary bigneſs.</p>
                  <p>They have an art to make this muddy water as clear as Cryſtal. As ſoon as the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers have fill'd their Veſſels, they rub them in the inſide with a Paſte made with pounded Almonds, which cauſeth the water to become in a ſhort time very clear.</p>
                  <p>In the places where this Paſte is not to be found, they uſe for that purpoſe the Kernels of Apricocks, pounded in the ſame manner. I was told, that the Flower of little Beans could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſame effect. The
<hi>Egyptians</hi> believe, that the River <hi>Nilus</hi> decreaſeth alſo at a certain day; namely, the 17th of their <hi>September,</hi> and the 24th of ours, the day which they obſerve in remembrance of the Exaltation of the Holy Croſs. They are ſo fully perſwaded of it, that if any ſhould deny it, he would be look'd upon as ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>The occaſion of this belief, as I conceive, is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the next day after this Feſtival, all the Banks and Stoppages of the River, on this ſide the <hi>Cairo,</hi> which were before kept ſhut, and guarded by armed men, that ſuch as need the water for their grounds might not open them, are cut and removed, and the water let into the Country. By this means the River ſpreads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad more than before, and its water returns <pb n="34" facs="tcp:106091:21"/>not back, which makes them ſay, that it riſeth and ſwells no more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe the day after the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> they do not take notice of its increaſe at the Pillar of <hi>Mikias,</hi> nor publiſh it about the Town, as before; they believe therefore that this is done, becauſe the River never increaſeth after.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe when the ſeaſons of the year in
<hi>Egypt</hi> are regular, the winds <hi>Maeſtrals</hi> that help to make the River ſwell, ceaſe after the 17th of <hi>September,</hi> and the Southerly winds riſe, driving the waters out of the Fields.</p>
                  <p>Though theſe reaſons appear ſtrong enough, to prove the Opinion of the <hi>Copties,</hi> one cannot without offending them ſay, that the River may yet increaſe after that day, becauſe the winds
<hi>Maeſtrals,</hi> and the rains of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> may ſome years continue a longer time than ordinary, and ſo the River may increaſe a little, not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: for theſe winds have blown till the Month of
<hi>November.</hi> In the year 1672. at the <hi>Calliz</hi> of <hi>Cairo</hi> it was viſible, that the water was riſen three fingers higher than the day before, in the night of the Exaltation of the <hi>Holy Croſs.</hi> It may be ſaid, that this increaſe was not real, but only cauſed by ſome ſtoppage at the paſſage of the River, or at one of the Bridges of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel out of the City: For my part, let every one believe what ſeems moſt likely.</p>
                  <p>From hence we may ſee how much ſome Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers have been miſtaken, when they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſwade us, that the River
<hi>Nilus</hi> never increaſeth above 40 days: For if you reckon the beginning of its increaſe, from the <pb n="35" facs="tcp:106091:21"/>17th of <hi>June</hi> till the 14th of <hi>Septemb.</hi> the day of its decreaſe, you ſhall find that it increaſeth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring 100 days at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>There cannot be a greater Teſtimony of this, than the Cuſtom of the <hi>Copties,</hi> who in their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick have a form of prayer for the increaſe of the River, which they ſay from the 12th day of <hi>Baoni,</hi> or <hi>June,</hi> till the 8th of <hi>Babe,</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> which is in all 120 days. In which prayer they deſire, that God would cauſe the River to riſe to its neceſſary height, to water ſufficiently the Country, as <hi>Abulbaracat,</hi> a famous Author a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the
<hi>Copties,</hi> ſaith in his work called <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah iddolme,</hi> which I have brought from <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> altogether ignorant, aſcribe this ordinary decreaſe to a Miracle. They obſerve the Feſtival of the Exaltation of the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> at which time they bleſs a Croſs at the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> which they caſt into
<hi>Nilus,</hi> and imagine that this Croſs ſtops the increaſe of the River.</p>
                  <p>Their Patriarch was wont to perform this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony with great pomp and ſtate; but becauſe the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> ſuffer them not to go in Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Cities publickly, their Prieſts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Cuſtom every one in his own Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.</p>
                  <p>The waters of this River have ſeveral Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 1. They cauſe a Looſeneſs to the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers, if they drink of them at their firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, which continues about eight days. 2. They cauſe an itch in the skin, which troubles ſuch as drink of them when the River increaſes. This itch is very ſmall, and appears firſt about the Arms, next upon the Stomach, and ſpreads all <pb n="36" facs="tcp:106091:22"/>about the Body, which cauſeth a grievous pain. This Itch comes not only upon ſuch as drink of the River, but ſuch as drink of the waters of the Ciſterns filled with the River water. It laſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix Weeks. 3. About the Month of <hi>June, July, Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> it turns into a ſwet, but is not ſo in any other time of the year. 4. When this water covers the Earth, it fats the Land with the ſlime that it leaves behind. Monſieur <hi>Th.</hi> is miſtaken in his Travels into the <hi>Levant,</hi> when he ſaith, that this ſlime makes the ground ſo fat, that if they did not mingle Sand with it, the ground would rot, and choak what is put into it; and that in <hi>Egypt</hi> they take as much pains to carry Sand into the ground, as we do to carry dung. This is not generally ſo; for they never uſe Sand, but for Melons, Cucumbers, and ſuch like Fruits, which grow only in ſandy ground; they never uſe Sand for other Fruits and Grains.</p>
                  <p>When the River runs over, it makes a great deſtruction; it carries away not only great pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Bank, but deſtroys ſometimes Towns and Villages near to it. This may eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the ruines of the Houſes, and the old Walls, ſeen all along the ſides of the River.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it alters its Channel. I have read in the
<hi>Mekkin,</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtorian, that about the time that the
<hi>Arabians</hi> conquer'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſo high, as to touch the Walls of the <hi>Caſſr Iſſcémma,</hi> a part of the old <hi>Cairo;</hi> and that it ran near the Church of <hi>Mary Moncure,</hi> which is in that of the Patriarchs, in the Street called in that time
<hi>Háret il bahr,</hi> The Street of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; <pb n="37" facs="tcp:106091:22"/>whereas now it is above a mile off from this place.</p>
                  <p>One day as I was walking out of the old <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> in the Fields, near the Church of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> the <hi>Copties</hi> ſhewed me a Garden near adjoyning, which was about 10 years ago upon the Banks of the River, but at preſent it is above a Musket ſhot off, becauſe the River hath taken as much ground on the other ſide, as it hath leſt on this.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee whether the Kings of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> are able to divert the courſe of the River, and cauſe all the Inhabitants to periſh with hunger, as ſome imagine. I am of this Opinion, though the Father <hi>Telles</hi> ſuppoſeth and alledgeth many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in his Hiſtory of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Theſe are the Reaſons that oblige me to believe it poſſible.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Letter of <hi>David,</hi> King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> written to <hi>Abu ſeid Barcúk,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the year of the Martyrs, 1193. I have a Copy of it written in <hi>Arabick,</hi> in which he threatens him in two diſtinct places of his Letter, to turn aſide the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> and hinder it from entering into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to cauſe all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to periſh with hunger, if he continues to vex the <hi>Copties,</hi> whom he names his Brethren. He ſaith, that he hath received from God this priviledge, which he had not diſcover'd to any of his Predeceſſors.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Kings of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Current of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and turn'd it out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the days of <hi>Moſtanſir,</hi> one of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffes</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> which obliged him to ſend the Patriarch of the <hi>Copties</hi> with rich Preſents to the King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> to intreat him to take away
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106091:23"/>the Bank which he had raiſed to turn aſide the River. The King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> having granted him this requeſt for the Patriarchs ſake, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver increaſed in one night three Cubits, which was ſufficient to water the Fields with that water that was there before; as we may ſee in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Muſulmans</hi> of <hi>George le Mekkin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt thing that Strangers may take notice of in ſailing upon the River, is the great number of Iſlands, whereof ſome be very great,
20 miles in compaſs: They proceed firſt from the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of Veſſels that have ſtuck in the mud. This happens frequently through the unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Mariners, and the mud of the River, the ſlowneſs of the Current, the dirt and mire gathers immediately about any thing that ſtops there; by this means theſe places increaſe into Iſlands. Almoſt every day new Iſlands are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable: And becauſe the State of
<hi>Egypt</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver chang'd ſince the Conqueſt of Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> and that theſe Iſlands have been made ſince, they are not recorded in the Rolls of the <hi>Divan</hi> of that time. From hence it is that they pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> but belong to the <hi>Pacha,</hi> who lets them out to the <hi>Caſciefs</hi> of the Province, where theſe Iſlands are ſcituated, or to whom he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Several Pillars have been erected in divers times to meaſure the riſing of the River.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was at <hi>Menuf,</hi> or <hi>Memphis,</hi> built by
<hi>Joſeph Jacobſon.</hi> When this fell to ruine, a rich Lady of the
<hi>Copties,</hi> named <hi>Deluca,</hi> erected two others; one at
<hi>Inſine,</hi> or <hi>Thebe,</hi> and the other at <hi>Achmin.</hi> When this laſt decayed, the <hi>Greeks</hi> built one at <hi>Caſſr Iſſcemma,</hi> whereof the Ruines are yet to be ſeen, as ſome ſay.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106091:23"/>
                  <p>Ater that <hi>Amru ibn il Aſſ</hi> had conquered
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> he cauſed one to be built at <hi>Inſine</hi> for the ſame purpoſe. This remained entire till the days of <hi>Abd il aziz ibn Mervan,</hi> a <hi>Califf</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who cauſed one to be built at <hi>Helvan,</hi> a place where he delighted to dwell.</p>
                  <p>The laſt of theſe Pillars ſtands in the <hi>Roude,</hi> an Iſland, where it remains to this very day. It was erected by the Command of
<hi>Azamed ibn zid, il Nettuchi,</hi> as we may ſee in the <hi>Macrizi,</hi> in the <hi>Serrur,</hi> and other <hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtories.</p>

                  <head>Of the Pillar of <hi>Mikias,</hi> and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they take notice of the Rivers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</head>
                  <p>THE Name of <hi>Mikias,</hi> in its right ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is nothing but a place where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be meaſured: But when at
<hi>Cairo Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kias</hi> is named, they underſtand only the Pillar which is in the Palace of the <hi>Roude,</hi> an Iſland, which ſerves to obſerve the increaſe of <hi>Nilus.</hi> This Iſland is named <hi>Roude,</hi> or
<hi>Garden,</hi> becauſe it is a delightful place, and full of many pleaſant Gardens. It ſtands over againſt <hi>Grand Carro,</hi> from whence it is diſtant about a Musket-ſhot. This Pillar is in the Palace of the Iſle <hi>Roude;</hi> and to come to it, one muſt paſs by a great and a beautiful <hi>Moſquée:</hi> Therefore it is a difficult matter for a Chriſtian to ſee it, becauſe the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> do not ſuffer them to enter into their <hi>Moſquées,</hi> chiefly in <hi>Egypt,</hi> for they believe that they would by their entrance defile and profane them. For this <pb n="40" facs="tcp:106091:24"/>cauſe I could not have the liberty to ſee it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot give any other deſcription than that of <hi>Amer ibn il verdi,</hi> and of <hi>Macrizi,</hi> famous Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians of the
<hi>Arabians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is, as they ſay, of white Marble, of an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctogone</hi> figure, ſtanding in a Pond of water, into which the water of <hi>Nilus</hi> enters in by a large Channel. It is divided upon the eight Angles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two and twenty Cubits, from the top to the bottom: The firſt is divided into 24 equal parts, called Fingers; the ſecond is not divided; the third is divided as the firſt; thus alternatively, till the eleventh Cubit. The firſt Cubit of the ſecond ſide is not divided, the ſecond is divided into four and twenty thumbs, the third is not, thus, till the eleventh, which with the others, to the bottom, are divided into eighteen fingers or thumbs. All the other ſides are divided in the ſame manner; ſo that all the Cubits which are divided in a ſide, anſwer to the Cubits which are not divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the other ſide. The increaſe of the River is diſcerned from the top to the bottom. The
<hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> ſay that <hi>John Mekaukes,</hi> a famous Man of their Nation, and a Governour of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for the Emperour <hi>Heraclius,</hi> laid the Foundations of this Palace, and of the Church which is near a
<hi>Moſquée.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Chriſtianity flouriſh'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to one of their Prieſts to examine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the River; which action was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three hours after midnight, and after Maſs. This is very likely. The laſt Prieſt of the <hi>Copties</hi> that meaſured it, was named <hi>Raddat,</hi> who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in that Office by making himſelf a
<hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> that none but his Poſterity might have this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106091:24"/>Office. <hi>Ibn Raddat,</hi> who now executes this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is deſcended from him, and is a <hi>Caddi</hi> by Profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> are Enemies of the
<hi>Copties,</hi> they obſerve ſome Cuſtomes now which were then kept, when their Prieſts did meaſure the River; for they do this about Even-ſong, that is, about three hours in the afternoon. They that muſt examine the increaſe of the River, muſt be <hi>Cadis,</hi> or Judges, an Eccleſiaſtical Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction amongſt the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> They do it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have firſt purified themſelves, and ſaid their prayers of the Even, as the <hi>Copties</hi> after Maſs.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Ibn Raddat</hi> hath taken notice of the number of the Fingers that ſignifie the increaſe of the River, he takes three times the water in the hollow of his hand, and flings it as often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the air: He repeats afterwards the Chapter of <hi>Fatha,</hi> and departs with the news of the riſing of the water to the <hi>Pacha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 29th of <hi>June,</hi> the Feſtival of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> they begin to publiſh abroad this increaſe through the City of <hi>Cairo;</hi> the manner of this publication is ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by Monſieur <hi>Thevenot.</hi> This day is the
26th of <hi>Baoni,</hi> or the <hi>June</hi> of the <hi>Copties,</hi> which is the Feſtival of the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi> They call this day in their Language, <hi>Beſciaret innil be Maſſr;</hi> or, The day of the publication of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nilus</hi> at <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They that are imployed in this buſineſs, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a particular Cuſtom: They never declare exactly the number of the fingers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, but always keep back ſome, till the time <pb n="42" facs="tcp:106091:25"/>comes that the <hi>Calitz</hi> is to be cut. For example, if
<hi>Nilus</hi> be increaſed ten fingers the firſt day, they will declare but ſeven or eight the next day, and will conceal three or four: if in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day it increaſeth twelve fingers, they will diſcover but eight or nine, and keep back three or four. Thus they continue 20 days, till the time comes that the Bank is to be cut that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the River from running into the Channel of <hi>Cairo;</hi> then they reveal ſome of thoſe fingers which they conceal'd. All which they conſtantly perform, until the day comes that they cry out <hi>Ouf Alla,</hi> that the River is come to its perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to water all the Fields of <hi>Egypt.</hi> They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this method, as they ſay, to cauſe more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the people, by diſcovering a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fingers at once, at the time when the Bank is cut. This makes them expect a year of Plenty.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Have taken notice of one particular thing concerning
<hi>Nilus,</hi> worthy of the knowledge of our Learned Wits, which never any Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of <hi>Europe</hi> hath yet given any account of. At
<hi>Argenus,</hi> or <hi>Gernus,</hi> as ſome call it corruptly, a Village near <hi>Behneſe,</hi> a Town ſcituate in the middle of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there is a Monaſtery of <hi>Copties,</hi> with a Church dedicated to the Bleſſed Virgin, where there is a Well whereof the waters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſwell every year, that ſame night in which the Dew falls, in ſuch a manner, that from thence it is eaſie to gather how many Cubits the River will riſe that year above ſixteen. To know this, they obſerve this Cuſtom.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:106091:25"/>
                  <p>The Evening before the Dew falls, the <hi>Cadi,</hi> together with the Elder of this Town, goes to the Church with a little Cord of Cotton, having eight knots diſtant from one another about a thumb; at the end there is a piece of Lead, which they let down into the Well in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a crowd of people. As ſoon as the Lead touches the top of the water, they tye the ſtring, and ſtop the Well, ſealing it with their Seal: Afterwards they go to the Church, and continue there till the morning, at which time they examine how much the water is riſen that night, for at break of day they take away the Seal, they open the Well, and draw up the Cord. Now by the riſing of the water in the Well, and the number of the knots that are wet, they can Prognoſticate how many Cubits the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will riſe that year above ſixteen. They reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Cubit for every knot that is wet: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if there be four knots wet, they underſtand that the River will riſe four Cubits that year, that is in all twenty; ſo they judge of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, I know not whether this be true, or whether it be but a Cheat, as the late holy <hi>Greek</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of

                  <head>Of the <hi>Crocodile.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Crocodile,</hi> in <hi>Arabick</hi> called
<hi>Timſáh,</hi> is the moſt remarkable and moſt curious Animal belonging to the River <hi>Nilus.</hi> I have therefore thought that it deſerv'd a particular Deſcription amongſt the Fiſhes of this Current. That it might be the more punctual and exact, I ſhall firſt repeat what
<hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, and afterwards add what I have taken notice of. This Learned <pb n="45" facs="tcp:106091:26"/>Naturaliſt tells us that <hi>The Crocodile is an Animal with four Legs that makes a grievous deſtruction both in the Water, and out upon the Land. Of all the Creatures that live upon the Earth, this alone is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Tongue, and this alone moves the upper-jaw in eating. It hath two ranks of great Teeth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is longer than</hi> 18
<hi>Cubits. It produceth Eggs about the bigneſs of a Gooſe-Egg, that it ſits upon them out of the Water, and lays them at the place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the Water is to riſe that Year, when it is at its higheſt; as if it had a knowledge of this before-hand. It is the only Creature that riſeth from ſuch a ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to ſuch a prodigious bigneſs. It is Armed with Claws to defend it ſelf. Its Skin on the Back is ſo extraordinary hard that no Weapon, never ſo ſharp, is able to enter it. In the Day-time it lies upon the Ground, and ſpends the Nights in the Waters. When its Belly is very full, it ſleeps upon the Bank with its Mouth open; then there comes a little Bird, named</hi> Trochilos, <hi>To eat the remains of the devoured Prey which ſticks between the Teeth: with this Food it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes it ſelf, and by the picking of the Teeth it gives the</hi> Crocodile <hi>a pleaſure, which cauſeth him to fall aſleep in this poſture. At that time the</hi> Ichneumon <hi>takes notice of the</hi> Crocodile <hi>at a diſtance, and when it ſees its time it enters into the others Mouth, ſlides down the Throat into the Belly, and gnaws the Entrails; with this the</hi> Crocodile <hi>dies. In the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Nilus <hi>are alſo,</hi> as he ſaith, Dolphins <hi>which have a very ſharp Back, with which they kill the</hi> Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles <hi>that purſue them continually. For that purpoſe theſe</hi> Dolphins <hi>ſeem to be afraid of the ravenous Beaſt, which cauſeth them to hide themſelves in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters under the</hi> Crocodiles; <hi>then, with their ſharp backs, they rip open the others belly. This Creature,</hi> 
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:106091:27"/>ſaith he, <hi>is very bold and daring to them that run from it, but timerous and fearful if it be purſued. It is very weak-ſighted in the Water, but out of the Water it is quick. In the Winter it ſpends four Months in ſome Cave, without eating. It lives long, and grows continually till it dies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the account that <hi>Pliny</hi> gives of the
<hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile.</hi> We will a little examine what he ſaith, and to that we ſhall add our own obſervations.</p>
                  <p>It is true that the <hi>Crocodile</hi> is a very dreadful Creature in <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe of the great deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that it makes in the Water, and out; for it devours not only all the Fiſh that it can catch in the River, but alſo the Camels, the Horſes, the Sheep, the wild Beeves, the Dogs, and little Children. In ſhort, all that it can catch upon the Land, it draws into the River, and eats it.</p>
                  <p>Concerning its length, which <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith is commonly above 18 Cubits, I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I know not how many Inches are his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; for, many Hunters of <hi>Crocodiles</hi> have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me that it grows never above a Cubit in length in a Year; and when it comes to twelve years old it grows no more: ſo that, according to this account, the longeſt
<hi>Crocodile</hi> is not above 12 Cubits in length. If this be true, the
<hi>Arabian</hi> Author, whom <hi>Ibn Beitar</hi> mentions in his Book of Animals and Plants, is miſtaken, when he ſaith, that there are ſome
<hi>Crocodiles</hi> that have their Tails 6 Cubits long, their Head two, and the reſt of their Body 8.</p>
                  <p>The Eggs that he lays, which are ſometimes in Number 30, never
100, as a certain Traveller affirms, are as big as the Eggs of Auſtriches;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106091:27"/>three-times bigger than Geeſe-Eggs. As ſoon as they are out of its Body, it carries them into ſome Iſland of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and puts them into a hole made with its fore-feet, it covers them with Sand, and ſmooths the place where they lye that no Perſon might diſcover them. In this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it leaves them, till by a natural Inſtinct it knows that the young are formed. It goes then and opens the hole and breaks the ſhell with its Muſle for the young to creep out. As ſoon as they are in the Air, they run ſtrait to the River. And becauſe ſome of theſe Eggs are rotten, it is from this corruption that a certain <hi>Lizard,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the
<hi>Arabs, Varal,</hi> is ingendred. We ſhall ſpeak of this Serpent in the ſequel of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Trochilos</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a further inquiry; for one might ask an hundred years in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> what this Bird is, and yet none is able to give an account.
<hi>Beitar</hi> ſaith this of it, when the <hi>Crocodile</hi> is full with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured Prey, he goes out of the Water to ſleep in the Sun; and becauſe its Teeth are full of ſlime and filth, in which the Worms are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; a certain Bird, as little as a <hi>Teitavi,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters between his Jaws, eats up the ſlime, and the Worms, if there be any; and when the
<hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile</hi> feels that all is clean, he ſhuts his Mouth to eat the Bird alſo. But Nature hath provided an expedient to ſecure it; there are two ſharp pricks on the top of the Birds Head, which when the
<hi>Crocodile</hi> feels, he opens his Jaws again for the Bird to eſcape out.</p>
                  <p>I inquired from ſeveral <hi>Moors,</hi> whether they knew any Bird that had any pricks on the Head? <pb n="48" facs="tcp:106091:28"/>They anſwered, they knew none. They told me, that there is in <hi>Egypt</hi> the <hi>Saksak,</hi> a Bird that keeps the <hi>Crocodile</hi> always company, which I have ſeen very often, and which lives upon the filth that ſticks about, and between, the
<hi>Crocodile</hi>'s Teeth. Whether therefore the <hi>Saksak</hi> of the
<hi>Moors,</hi> and the Bird mentioned by <hi>Beitar,</hi> be the
<hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilos</hi> of <hi>Pliny,</hi> I leave to the Reader to judge.</p>
                  <p>Concernining the <hi>Ichneumon,</hi> named by the <hi>Arabians, Nims,</hi> by the <hi>Italians, Sorca di faraone,</hi> and by the
<hi>French-men, Rat d' Egypte.</hi> It is very true that it creeps into the Mouth of the <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile,</hi> enters into its Belly, which it gnaws to the very Entrails; the like happens to the Camels, and wild Beeves, and other Animals, when they ſleep in the Fields.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks concerning the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins is not likely, for there be none in the River. But it may be it is the
<hi>Tirſe,</hi> which is the only Fiſh that aſſaults the
<hi>Crocodile.</hi> This <hi>Tirſe</hi> is as round as a Buckler which eats the young <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles</hi> when it can meet them.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Crocodiles</hi> can live a long while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, is a truth which I have ſeen by experience by two that I have kept alive a long while. I had one in my Cloſet about a Foot long, and another ſix in my Cellar. I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the latter to be tied with a great Cord about the Jaws, that it might not offend ſuch as came to ſee it. They lived both about a Month without eating. The <hi>Moors</hi> told me that they could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt forty days without any nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>They have, in all, three-ſcore and twelve great Teeth, very ſharp; ſix and thirty in the upper-jaw, and as many in the lower: So that
<hi>Ibn Beitar</hi> 
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:106091:28"/>is miſtaken, when he ſaith in his Hiſtory of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which I have ſent to the King's Library, that they have threeſcore in the upper-jaw, and forty in the lower; and that between every two ſharp and great Teeth, there is one ſquare and little one; for I have ſeen many alive and dead, but have never found this difference in the Teeth, but rather I have always found them to be ſharp and uniform.</p>
                  <p>Its four Paws are furniſhed with great Hooks, or Claws, very ſharp; the two Fore-feet having five diſtinct, ſeparated the one from the other; the two hinder but four, which are all joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a very thin skin, as are the Feet of all Sea-fowl, as Geeſe and Ducks.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabian</hi> Authors ſay, That it caſts out its Excrements by the Throat, becauſe it hath no hole under the Tail, and its Stones have the ſmell of Musk; but as I have had no experience neither of one nor t'other, I refer my ſelf to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the <hi>Crocodile</hi> cannot well turn it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Belly when it lies upon the Back, and that it is needful that the Female be in that poſture when the Male covers her. The Male takes care when he hath laid her upon her Back and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his duty, to turn her again upon her Belly, for fear of the Hunters.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo taken notice, that from the City <hi>Cairo,</hi> towards the upper <hi>Egypt,</hi> there are many <hi>Crocodiles</hi> to be found, where they do much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; but from thence towards the lower
<hi>Egypt</hi> are very few, and they ſay, that they be not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> give two Reaſons of this; they ſay,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106091:29"/>That one of their Saints, named <hi>Sidi Ibrahim il Zuphi,</hi> or <hi>The Lord Abraham of Zug,</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd them to hinder them from paſſing beyond the City <hi>Cairo,</hi> and bound them to hurt no body. The other Reaſon is, as they ſay, becauſe under the Pillar or
<hi>Mikias</hi> there is a <hi>Taliſman</hi> that kills them as ſoon as they draw near.</p>
                  <p>But it is moſt certain that there are ſome on this ſide the <hi>Cairo</hi> to be ſeen, though not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as on the other. This proceeds, as they ſay, from the <hi>Taliſman</hi> that is turn'd up-ſide down in this Pillar, and therefore loſeth its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt vertue; therefore they can paſs beyond it, ſwimming upon their Backs.</p>

                  <p>IN <hi>Egypt,</hi> as well as in other Countries ſubject to the Grand Seignior, there are ſeveral <hi>Sangiac-Beys,</hi> who be Governors of great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
                  <p>They are ſo called in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tongue from two words, <hi>Sangiac,</hi> which ſignifies an Enſign, and <hi>Bey,</hi> a Prince; becauſe when the Grand <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier,</hi> or the <hi>Pacha,</hi> makes them, he delivers into their hands an Enſign, as a mark of their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>They that may pretend to this Dignity are the <hi>Agas of the Boulouks, the Chieftains of the ſeven Orders of the Militia of Cairo,</hi> and the <hi>Metferracas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The greateſt part of theſe Lords are
<hi>Melteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>míns,</hi> or Farmers of the Provinces that they hold from the <hi>Divan,</hi> at the rates mentioned in the Rolls: heretofore ſome
<hi>Beys</hi> have Farmed four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Villages, or Towns. They Lett theſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages to under Farmers, and the uſual Rent of every Town, is known to every one, chiefly to the <hi>Mebaſcicríns,</hi> or Scrivners of the
<hi>Copties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About twenty years ago this honour was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd with the expence of twenty Purſes, or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: This was called <hi>Chidmet il Sangiakie.</hi> And as ſoon as any Perſon was made <hi>Bey,</hi> the
<hi>Divan</hi> did allow him half a Purſe every Month, as his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary; and when he travell'd to any Place, for the ſervice of the Grand Seignior, at his return to <hi>Cairo</hi> the <hi>Divan</hi> did give him half a Purſe more for his Reward. In that time theſe <hi>Beys</hi> wore in great Credit, and Power; for when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd their opinion in the <hi>Divan,</hi> the
<hi>Pacha</hi>'s <pb n="59" facs="tcp:106091:33"/>were afraid to contradict them. They did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times depoſe them, when they did not amend their manners after a reproof. They were wont to be ſix and thirty in Number.</p>
                  <p>But now they are a great deal leſs, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to that condition, that they are not much eſteem'd. This Honour now coſts them fifteen Purſes, and their Allowance given to them by the <hi>Divan</hi> is one thouſand Aſpers every day. So Aſpers is 4 <abbr>

                  </p>
                  <p>Their Office is, to Conduct the <hi>Hazna,</hi> or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, of the Grand Seignior to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or to Command the
<hi>Caravan</hi> that travels towards <hi>Mecha;</hi> and to go to War, when required. Four of them are to watch always round about <hi>Cairo,</hi> with a Company of Janiſſaries.

                     <p>IN <hi>Egypt</hi> are to be found ſeveral Trees very rare, which are not in <hi>Europe. Lebaca</hi> is one which, as the <hi>Copties</hi> Stories relate, worſhipped our Saviour Chriſt when he came firſt to

                     <p>The <hi>Hilélgie</hi> is a great Tree full of prickles. I have ſeen one in the Monaſtery of <hi>Abuhennis,</hi> ſcituate in the middle <hi>Egypt,</hi> almoſt over againſt <hi>Melave.</hi> I was told that it bears a Fruit like to yellow <hi>Daſies.</hi> The <hi>Sycamore,</hi> named by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians, Gomeize,</hi> is one of the ordinary ſort of Trees; as alſo the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> which is of four ſorts, 1.

                        <hi>Gum-tree. Zante,</hi> which is called <hi>Acacia.</hi> The <hi>Maſtick,</hi> I have ſeen too in the Monaſtery of St.

That its Leaves burſt forth only at the end of its Branches, and in the thick Bunches. 2. That they are ſo equal, and even at the end of the Branches, that to look upon them one would think that ſome have cut, and even'd them with Sciſſers. The Leaves are very thin and long, and are like the Leaves of the Palm-tree.

                     <p>When it intends to Hatch its Egs, it ſits not upon them, as other Birds; but the Male and the Female Hatches them with their Eye only; and when either of them hath need to ſeek for Food, he gives notice to the other by crying; and the other continues to look upon the Egs, till it be return'd: likewiſe when the other hath the ſame deſire to ſeek about for Food, he gives the ſame notice, with the ſame ſhriek, that its Companion might remain ſtill to look upon the Egs, till they be all Hatch'd: For if they did but look off a moment, the Egs would ſpoil and rot.</p>
                     <p>The Church of the <hi>Copies</hi> hath learn'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Cuſtome from the Practice of this Bird: They hang up a lighted Lamp, between two Egs of an <hi>Auſtrich,</hi> over againſt the Prieſts that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate, to adviſe them to be attentive about their Devotions; that their Prayers might be more efficacious, and might not loſe their ſtrength, for want of attention.</p>

1672. where I abode till the 8th day of the next Month: Sometimes lodging in the City, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Barque that had brought me, becauſe it was loaden with Wine for the Conſul, and <hi>French</hi> Merchants of
<hi>Cairo:</hi> And the <hi>Aga</hi> of the City would not ſuffer the Wine to be carried a-ſhore, nor into the Haven, until the <hi>Pacha</hi> had ſent him an expreſs Order to that purpoſe.

               </p>
               <p>Here follows the moſt remarkable Paſſages, and the Deſcription of the Towns, and Places, which are from the Mouth of the River at <hi>Damietta,</hi> 
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:106091:37"/>as far as <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> as they lye in order.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as we enter into the River, from the Sea, we find on the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide, at the Mouth, an old Caſtle ruinated, but ſmall; which, as the <hi>Francs</hi> ſay, was built by S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, when he had <hi>Damietta.</hi> It is ſquare, and divided into four round Turrets, upon which ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery have been planted to command the Paſſage, and where a few <hi>Moors</hi> are upon the Guard.</p>
               <p>A little further into the River ſtands a poor Village, named
<hi>Bogas,</hi> or Mouth of the River; becauſe it is there ſcituated. The
<hi>Arabian</hi> word <hi>Bogas</hi> ſignifying ſo much.</p>
               <p>In this Village dwell the Owners of the <hi>Germes</hi> (being Long-Boats made to un-load Ships and draw them out of the Sands) that guide and tow along the Ships that ſail in or out of the River; and diſcover to them the Banks of Sand, which are very ordinary in this Road.</p>
               <p>In this Village is to be ſeen the Foundation of another ſquare Fort, the Walls whereof are not yet finiſh'd, and never likely to be. There are alſo here two <hi>Calitz,</hi> or Artificial Channels, full of the River-water all the year; made on purpoſe to water the Fields.</p>
               <p>About an hundred Paces from this Village, on the other ſide, is another Caſtle to command the Mouth; ſo that the two Caſtles that are there planted for this purpoſe, are not over againſt one another.</p>

                     <hi>DAmietta,</hi> called by the <hi>Arabians, Damiát,</hi> a famous City of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is ſcituate upon the
<hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> about eight Miles from the Mouth. Next to <hi>Cairo</hi> it is the greateſt, moſt beautiful, the richeſt, the moſt populous, and the fulleſt of Merchants of all <hi>Egypt;</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Trade draws thither a great number of People form all parts of <hi>Turkie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is built upon the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> in the form of an half Moon. The Waves of this River that waſh the Foundations of their Houſes on that ſide, and the great number of beautiful <hi>Moſques,</hi> together with the Fleet of Ships and Barques that ride in the Haven, yield a moſt delightful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
                  <p>There are no Walls, nor Fortifications, only a round, and very high Tower, that ſtands at the end of the Town towards the Sea; where there is neither Watch nor Ward, nor Guns.</p>
                  <p>In this City there is great Trading in Linen, Rice, Coffee, and Stuffs. I was told, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year, about five hundred Ships go out of this Haven, ſmall and great, loaded with Rice for <hi>Turkie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are made many beautiful ſorts of Linen of all kinds and colours, which are Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Foreign Countries. Here is alſo a great deal of Fiſh ſalted. The <hi>Mullet</hi> that are here pickled are highly eſteem'd all over the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Town is Governd by an <hi>Aga,</hi> ſent thither from the
<hi>Pacha,</hi> and therefore nam'd by the <hi>Turks, <pb n="68" facs="tcp:106091:38"/>Pachagaſi,</hi> or the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Pacha.</hi> Beſides his other Incomes, he takes from every Tavern of <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae</hi> ten
<hi>Pora's,</hi> in the City are a great many ſuch Taverns. From every
<hi>Carache</hi> (it being a little Ship) he receives five <hi>Pora's;</hi> and from greater Ships ſix and thirty, and forty, when they go out of the Port: Beſides many Caſualties which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a great deal, through his extortion, as the manner of the <hi>Turks</hi> is: for, out of our Ship he took ſix Barrels of <hi>Cyprus</hi>-wine, containing each ſix <hi>Metres,</hi> and every <hi>Metre</hi> holding twenty Pots, though this was not his due. I had ſome difficulty to ſave from his greedy hands a Box of excellent Wine of the Country of <hi>Keſrovan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Souldiery, and chiefly the <hi>Janiſſaries,</hi> are very inſolent. There be but two hundred, and about twenty
<hi>Spahins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the Chriſtians, the <hi>Grecks</hi> are the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous. They be about two hundred Families, and have a conſiderable Church.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Copties</hi> there be about eight Families. The
<hi>Turks,</hi> about a year ſince, took Poſſeſſion of their Church, becauſe they had not paid them a certain Tax that they had laid upon them.</p>
                  <p>There are no <hi>Francs</hi> that dwell there in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for want of Trade; becauſe this Haven is at a little diſtance from all the Chriſtian Countries, and becauſe they are ſettled at <hi>Roſetta,</hi> which lies more convenient for them, and nearer. There is only a Chamber which the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land have hired in the Apartment of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Patriarch, which is a little Houſe, very filthy, yet they Lodge there when they paſs to and fro from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to
<hi>Cairo.</hi> The greateſt Traffick in this City, by Sea, is of Wood and Timber which <pb n="69" facs="tcp:106091:38"/>is Imported as well for Fewel as for the building of Houſes and Ships; for Wood is very ſcarce in <hi>Egypt,</hi> chiefly in the Inferiour.</p>
                  <p>During my abode in this City I met with an old Ship-Captain, by Religion a <hi>Maronite,</hi> who told me, that between this City and the Town of <hi>Bogas,</hi> the River <hi>Nilus</hi> grew ſhallower every year; and that he had taken notice, that about fifteen years ago it was fifteen Cubits deep; but now ſcarce fifteen Foot. This proceeds from the Earth, which the Water looſens from its ſides and waſhes into the middle; about the Mouth of the River there the Earth ſtops. He gather'd from thence, that it was to be fear'd, that in this River great Ships would not be able, one day, to paſs from the Mouth to <hi>Damietta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Town of <hi>Manſoura,</hi> i. e. <hi>Victorious,</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of the <hi>Caſcief</hi> of <hi>Dekahlie,</hi> is a great and beautiful Town, ſcituate upon the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus.</hi> Its Houſes are not builded as thoſe of <hi>Damietta,</hi> upon the Water, but there is a large Street between them for to walk; but becauſe we Landed not then in that place, I had not the opportunity to view it, nor to give an exact De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only ſay this of it, That in this Town the
<hi>French</hi> King, S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> was taken Priſoner by Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<hi>Saleh, negm iddin, eiiub ibn il Kamel.</hi> All the particulars of the end, and carrying on of this War, are to be ſeen in the <hi>Macrizi,</hi> and in
<hi>Ibn Zulak.</hi> I could wiſh theſe Hiſtories of the
<hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> were Tranſlated into any known Languages, for here are ſeveral remarkable Circumſtances mentioned in them, with which we are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. Here are likewiſe many Verſes full <pb n="70" facs="tcp:106091:39"/>of Wit, but Satyrical, made then by the <hi>Moors,</hi> upon the taking of S.
<hi>Lewis,</hi> and the concluſion of this War, ſo happy for their Nation.</p>
                  <p>Between <hi>Damietta</hi> and Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> are to be ſeen, upon the River ſide, a prodigious number of Pigeon-houſes, which is here remarkable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are not found ſo many in any other part of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> nor builded in the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Pigeon-houſes begin at <hi>Mitbedri,</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage near <hi>Manſoura,</hi> on the ſame ſide, in ſailing towards
<hi>Cairo.</hi> In one days Journey and a half I ſaw ſo many, that I wondred at it; for there is ſcarce a Houſe in all the Villages but there is one, or more Pigeon-houſes. At the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Walls are of Earth only, and round on the top, very ſpacious within, full of Earthen Pots for the Pigeons Neſts; and without are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Poles for them to pitch on, and reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is eaſie to judge whether the ſight, and Proſpect of ſo many Pigeon-houſes be not very delightful.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> that were in our Boat told us, that in theſe Villages fifteen Pigeons were commonly ſold for one <hi>Para;</hi> forty <hi>Para's</hi> make 4 <abbr>
                        <hi>s.</hi>
                     </abbr> 6
<abbr>
                        <hi>d.</hi>
                     </abbr> So that I reckon, that about two hundred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Couples were ſold for that Money.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Semennut</hi> is a great Town, ſcituate on the
<hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> in the <hi>Caſcieftik</hi> of
<hi>Garbie,</hi> not far from <hi>Mohelle Kabíre,</hi> or the great
<hi>Mohelle.</hi> It is built in a Triangular Form; the lower part ſtretches it ſelf along the River. The Barques that ſail towards <hi>Cairo</hi> are bound to ſtop here, and pay Cuſtome: The Cuſtome-houſe is built upon a Ship, in the River, at which the Veſſels ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtop above an hour.</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:106091:39"/>
                  <p>In the middle Way, between <hi>Diametta</hi> and <hi>Cairo,</hi> is <hi>Mitgamr,</hi> a very beautiful and large Town, ſcituate upon the
<hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus.</hi> We landed, and I found there many fair Houſes, and a ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Bazar,</hi> or Market-place, where all manner of Proviſions were to be ſold. Here are alſo a great many Chriſtians of the <hi>Copties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Over againſt <hi>Mitgamr,</hi> that is on the
<hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide <hi>Nilus,</hi> is <hi>Sitfe,</hi> a beautiful and big Town, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to to the <hi>Caſcieftik</hi> of <hi>Mohelle Kebíre;</hi> where we beheld a purſuit of ſome Peaſants, whom the
<hi>Caſcief</hi> of that Province chas'd. They were come to demand a certain Tribute, which he was wont to pay them: and upon his denial of it they roſe up in Arms againſt him: But as ſoon as he had ſent out the
<hi>Spahins</hi> againſt them, they ran all away. Theſe poor
<hi>Caitiffs</hi> being on Foot, and finding themſelves followed by Horſe-men; that they might not fall into their hands, they caſt themſelves, in haſte, into the River to ſwim over; ſix were unhappily drown'd before our Eyes.</p>
                  <p>In the upper <hi>Egypt</hi> is a Village, named alſo
<hi>Sitfe;</hi> which I ſhall mention in another place.</p>
                  <p>The 12th of <hi>April,</hi> about two a-Clock in the Afternoon, we left one of the Branches of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> that leaves the main River and runs to <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etta,</hi> and entred into the <hi>Bogas,</hi> or Channel of
<hi>Boulac.</hi> The clear Weather gave me the liberty to take notice of the ſeparation of the two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the River: I found that the Branch that goes to <hi>Roſetta</hi> ſtretches it ſelf to the <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> and that of <hi>Diametta</hi> to the <hi>North.</hi> In reſpect of this laſt, <hi>Cairo</hi> ſtands to the <hi>South-Eaſt,</hi> and its Caſtle to the <hi>South.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this <hi>Bogas</hi> the two great <hi>Pyramides</hi> of
<hi>Egypt</hi> 
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:106091:40"/>are firſt diſcover'd: They appear here to be equal, though one is far higher than the other.</p>
                  <p>From this ſeparation, or diviſion of <hi>Nilus,</hi> as far as <hi>Boulac,</hi> there is but an hour and a halfs travelling, though Monſieur <hi>Thevenot</hi> tells us of ſix Leagues.</p>
                  <p>We landed at <hi>Boulac,</hi> the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> before
<hi>Eaſter,</hi> at Night. I ſtaid there till the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and entred into <hi>Cairo</hi> about Noon. At my entrance I paid a Crown, at the Cuſtome-houſe of <hi>Boulac,</hi> which is an ordinary Tribute demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all <hi>Francs</hi> many years ago.</p>

                  <head>A Deſcription of the City of <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MY deſign at firſt, was to publiſh a large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of all the Rarities of this great and famous City, before I proceed on in my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: But ſince I have conſidered that great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes are wont to nauſeate, rather than to delight the Reader, chiefly in theſe days that Men are pleas'd with the reading of ſhort and ſmall Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes: I have therefore taken notice of thoſe things only which other Travellers have omitted, and could never know perfectly for want of an inſight into the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue. He that will know more, may peruſe the ſecond Part of the
<hi>Chottats</hi> of <hi>Macrizi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Cairo</hi> borrows the Name from the Planet
<hi>Mars,</hi> called by the <hi>Arabians, Kaher;</hi> which Name was given to it, as ſaith the <hi>Serrúr,</hi> an <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Hiſtorian, becauſe the Foundation of its Walls were laid when this Planet was in its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent; which hapned unhappily in this manner.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:106091:40"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Giauher,</hi> the General of <hi>Meez le dín allá,</hi> one of the <hi>Cailiffs</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> having reſolved to build a new City for the abode of his Lord, in the Year 362 of the <hi>Hegira;</hi> he gave orders to the Aſtronomers, to obſerve the time of the riſing of a good Star, when the Foundation might be laid; that the City might be the more happy, and of a longer continuance.</p>
                  <p>The Aſtronomers accordingly encompaſſed about with Ropes, all that ſpace of Ground that was to be ſhut into the Walls; tying to the Ropes a great many little Bells, to give notice to the Builders when they were to caſt the Foundation: The ſignal was, the ſounding of the Bells; which was to be given when they ſaw the riſing of a good Star.</p>
                  <p>By chance it happen'd, that a Crow pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ropes that was ſtretch'd along, when <hi>Mars</hi> was in its riſing; and with the motion of the Ropes cauſed the Bells to ſound: As ſoon as the Maſons heard the ſignal given, they caſt all, with one conſent, the Foundation: which when the Aſtronomers had underſtood, they declar'd by unlucky riſing of <hi>Mars,</hi> that govern'd at that Inſtant, that the City ſhould be one day taken by a Conqueror that ſhould come out of
<hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> where <hi>Mars</hi> governs: Which hath proved true about five hundred and threeſcore years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> came from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Romania,</hi> and took not only the City, but the whole Country; and deſtroyed the Race of their Kings, by hanging the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Though they conceived that this Star would prove unlucky, they called the City neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Kahera,</hi> or <hi>Cairo,</hi> as we name it in <hi>Europe:</hi> 
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:106091:41"/>which Name continues till this day. This City is become very rich, powerful, and great, by its Trade; inſomuch, that of all the Cities of the <hi>Levant,</hi> this alone hath deſerv'd the name of Great.</p>
                  <p>It is ſcituate in a Champain, very delightful, at the Foot of a Mountain of Sand, named in <hi>Arab. Gebel il mokattam,</hi> or the Mountain cut through, which ſtands on the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide, and incommodes the City; becauſe it deprives it of the benefit of the freſh Winds that blow from thence. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath another inconveniency, it is far from the River.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing in the World more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than to take a proſpect of it from ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place: for you might from thence view an infinite number of Houſes, which, inſtead of Coverings, have Turrets; and ſee an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of <hi>Moſques</hi> with their various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of differing Buildings intermingled, and ſurrounded with Palm-trees, and Gardens; all which together repreſents a moſt beautiful Proſpect.</p>
                  <p>It hath ſeven Gates. The Names are, 1. <hi>Bab zucile;</hi> 2.
<hi>Bab innaſſr;</hi> 3. <hi>Bab il fetúb;</hi> 4. <hi>Bab il Kántara;</hi> 5. <hi>Bab iſſcia a ríe;</hi> 6. <hi>Bab iſſaade;</hi> 7. <hi>Bab il mahrúk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are eight Lakes, very large, that belong to it: 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>There is a Channel cut through this City, from the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> to the <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> called the <hi>Calitz</hi> of

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106091:41"/>
                     <hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtorian, ſaith; That <hi>Tarſis ibn Malia,</hi> one of the <hi>Pharaoh's;</hi> and, as he believes, the King that took the Wife of <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> cauſed it firſt to be cut. Since the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> conquer'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> and took it from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Heraclius,</hi> they have named it
<hi>Calitz Emir il Muminin,</hi> or <hi>The Channel of the Prince of the faithful,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Amru ibn Chottab,</hi> the ſecond
<hi>Califf</hi> after <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was the firſt ſirnamed The Prince of the faithful, becauſe he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Amru ibn aſſ</hi> to lead him as far as <hi>Colzim,</hi> a Town ſcituate near the
<hi>Red-Sea,</hi> that he might convey the Proviſions of <hi>Cairo</hi> as far as this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and from thence by the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> to <hi>Mecha;</hi> where there was, at that time, a great want of Food. It continued in this manner till the Year 150 of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> when <hi>Ciafer il Manſur,</hi> a <hi>Califf</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of the Race of
<hi>Abbas,</hi> cauſed it to be ſtopt on that ſide which is towards the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Now it is called <hi>Calitz il Hakemi,</hi> or the <hi>Calitz of Hakem;</hi> becauſe <hi>Hakem-be amr ille,</hi> another <hi>Califf</hi> of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> cauſed this Channel, which was decayed through the negligence of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, to be repaired. It is called alſo
<hi>Merachemi,</hi> or the <hi>Calitz paved with Marble;</hi> as we may ſee by ſome Paſſages of the <hi>Serrúr,</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which I have brought with me from <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In my Relation of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Printed in <hi>Italian</hi> at
<hi>Paris,</hi> 1671. I ſaid that the <hi>Turks, Copties,</hi> and
<hi>Jews,</hi> open, in their turns, this Channel every Year: but I underſtand ſince, that this Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to the
<hi>Soubaſchi</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> who ſtrikes the firſt three, or four blows upon the Bank that hinders the River from entring into the Channel,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106091:42"/>afterwards all that will work have liberty granted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copies</hi> have but two Churches at <hi>Cairo;</hi> one in the Street named <hi>Haret Zuele,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the
<hi>Greek's</hi> Street. The firſt is Dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was built by a renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Phyſician, named <hi>Zabulon.</hi> He lived about two-hundred-ſeventy years before the <hi>Arabians</hi> became Maſters of <hi>Egypt.</hi> He is yet famous for his wonderful Riches. They ſay that he hid them in a Well which is in the ſame Church, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd them with a
<hi>Taliſman,</hi> that none might have them after his deceaſe. The Patriarch of the <hi>Copties</hi> Houſe is joining to this Church.</p>
                  <p>The other in the <hi>Greek's</hi> Street is Dedicated to S.
<hi>Barba.</hi> It is but ſmall, and obſcure. I went to ſee it the 4th of
<hi>November</hi> 1672.</p>
                  <p>Heretofore they had many Churches, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries; and a Biſhop in the <hi>Chandak,</hi> an old Suburb of <hi>Cairo,</hi> but now ruinated. But now they have but two; one Dedicated to the Arch-Angel
<hi>Gabriel;</hi> the other to the Abbot <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> ſirnamed
<hi>Roes.</hi> Here the <hi>Copties of Cairo</hi> have a Burying-place.</p>
                  <p>Of the many <hi>Moſques</hi> at <hi>Cairo,</hi> that which is called <hi>Giama ill aſſar</hi> is the richeſt, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. It was built by <hi>Giauher,</hi> the firſt Founder of the City: It is yet the Cathedral, where the four <hi>Mouftis,</hi> or Doctors of the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. It is a Refuge for Offenders, and a School for to teach the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> with its Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues it entertains no leſs than eight hundred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that Profeſſion; and receives for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two thouſand <hi>Ardebs</hi> of Corn, from the Store-houſes of the Grand <hi>Seignior;</hi> and ſeven <pb n="77" facs="tcp:106091:42"/>thouſand more from other Benefactors.</p>
                  <p>There are four <hi>Mouftis</hi> at <hi>Cairo</hi> that borrow their Names from the four chief Sects of <hi>Mahe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met:</hi> 1. Of

                  <head>A Deſcription of Old <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>OLD <hi>Cairo,</hi> ſo called erroneouſly by the
<hi>Francs,</hi> is named by the <hi>Arabians, Maſſr,</hi> from
<hi>Maſſr,</hi> or <hi>Mizraim,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> and Grand-child of <hi>Noah,</hi> that cauſed it to be built. It is the ancienteſt City of <hi>Egypt,</hi> next to <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis;</hi> after the deſtruction of this, Old <hi>Cairo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the chief. It is ſcituate on the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> over againſt the place where
<hi>Memphis</hi> ſtood, next to New <hi>Cairo.</hi> It was heretofore a ſtately City, but now it is almoſt all ruinated.</p>
                  <p>In the 18th year of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> which is about 1033 years ſince that <hi>Amru ibn il aſſ,</hi> General of <hi>Amru ibn Chottab,</hi> a ſucceſſor of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> took this City. <hi>John Mekaukes,</hi> a noble <hi>Coptie,</hi> was then Governour for the Emperour
<hi>Heraclius.</hi> When <hi>Amru</hi> had taken it, he made Peace with
<hi>Mekaukes,</hi> upon condition that every <hi>Coptie</hi> ſhould pay him, and all his Succeſſors, two-pence a-year as a Tribute; and that he ſhould give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for three days, to all the <hi>Arabians</hi> that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106091:43"/>ſhould paſs through <hi>Egypt;</hi> as may be ſeen more fully in the <hi>Macrizi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City hath been increas'd many times, as the Conquerors, and Lords of the Country, did think convenient to pitch upon a more pleaſant place for their abode.</p>
                  <p>The places where the <hi>Foſtat,</hi> the <hi>Caſſr iſcémma,</hi> the Quarter of the Patriarch of the <hi>Copties, Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Cateia,</hi> the <hi>Caraff,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foſtat</hi> is a <hi>Greek</hi> Name, which ſignifies a Tent of Goat-skins. The <hi>Arabians</hi> name one ſide of Old <hi>Cairo</hi> thus, becauſe the Tent of <hi>Amru ibn il aſſ,</hi> of this ſubſtance, was planted there when he was buſie in Conquering
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Amru</hi> cauſed it to be incloſed in with Walls; after that he had taken the City of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> he ſettled there his abode, and that of his Succeſſors: <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that had been the Royal City of the <hi>Greeks</hi> for about nine hundred years, was then forſaken; and the <hi>Foſtat</hi> was the chief City of
<hi>Egypt.</hi> It continued ſo till <hi>Ahmed ibn Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> built
<hi>Cateia</hi> very near <hi>Foſtat.</hi> His Succeſſors of his Race forſook it, and ſettled themſelves in <hi>Cateia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when this Race was extinct, and Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> being built by <hi>Giauher,</hi> as we have ſaid, the <hi>Califfs</hi> choſe it for their abode, cauſing <hi>Foſtat</hi> to be burnt, that the new City might be ſtronger, and fuller of People; and they left <hi>Cateia,</hi> as we may ſee in <hi>Macrizi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſſr Iſſcémma,</hi> is a Caſtle, or Suburb, incloſed with Walls, near adjoining to <hi>Foſtat,</hi> built by
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Now only Chriſtians inhabit there. They have many Churches which we ſhall deſcribe in this following Journal; for I <pb n="80" facs="tcp:106091:44"/>went to ſee them on the 18th day of
<hi>July,</hi> 1672.</p>
                  <p>There are two differing Opinions concerning the Origine of this Name. Some would have it written, <hi>Caſſr iggiama;</hi> that is, the Caſtle of the Aſſembly: for they ſay, that here the great Wits did meet to increaſe Learning; but this Opinion is not well grounded. Others write it
<hi>Caſſr iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcémma;</hi> this is likely to be the trueſt; for I find it thus written by all <hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtorians.</p>
                  <p>The Granaries and Store-houſes, of the Grand
<hi>Seignior,</hi> are adjoining to this Caſtle. They are named by the
<hi>Arabs, Scióne.</hi> The Proviſions of Corn, and other neceſſaries for the Food of the Malitia, are here kept; not only for the Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but alſo for all the other Countries that depend upon <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that this Corn might be better diſtributed, there are four
<hi>Aga's,</hi> or Officers, named in <hi>Arab. Agavat beta il ghelàl,</hi> or <hi>Aga's of the Stores</hi> in the upper
<hi>Egypt:</hi> One dwells at <hi>Beneſuef,</hi> another at <hi>Minie,</hi> the third at <hi>Momfallat,</hi> the fourth at <hi>Girge.</hi> Their Office is, to gather up the Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Corn, and to ſend them to the <hi>Emin il Scióne,</hi> the Maſter of the Store-houſes of the Grand
<hi>Seignior,</hi> who upon a certain day of the Month, cauſes theſe Proviſions to be diſtributed according as the Divan appoints.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe ſometimes this allowance is not ſufficient, every one hath liberty to buy more, by paying for every <hi>Ardeb</hi> a thouſand <hi>Meidins.</hi> When this Money is once paid, every year one may fetch this allowance, during the Buyer's life.</p>
                  <p>Near this <hi>Caſſr iſſcemma,</hi> on a ſide of
<hi>Cairo,</hi> is the Quarter of the Patriarch of the <hi>Copties,</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:106091:44"/>named in <hi>Arab. Haret il Batrak.</hi> It is ſeparated from this Caſtle with an high Wall, with which it is incloſed. The Patriarch hath his Abode a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above the Church of <hi>Mary Moncure;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, I ſhall take notice of ſome curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Babylon</hi> was further towards the <hi>South</hi> of
<hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro.</hi> Now there appears nothing but great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of its Ruines, and three Churches of the <hi>Copties;</hi> one dedicated to the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to S. <hi>Theodorus,</hi> the third to S. <hi>John Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kîr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church of the Virgin, as the <hi>Copties</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, was the firſt that was built at <hi>Cairo,</hi> after the coming of our Saviour Chriſt. They ſay that S. <hi>Mark</hi> hath preach'd there; and that S.
<hi>Peter</hi> mentions it at the end of his Epiſtle, when he ſaith, that the Church elect which is in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon Maſſr,</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> near <hi>Cairo,</hi> ſalute you, as well as my Son <hi>Marcus.</hi> I did not go into it at this time, but I ſaw it, and lay there one Night in my firſt Voyage to <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the year 1664.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cateia</hi> was built near <hi>Foſtat,</hi> by <hi>Ahmed ibn Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> Prince of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as we have already ſaid.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Caraffa</hi> is the Burying-place of the
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans;</hi> highly eſteem'd, becauſe there be ſome Kindred of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> and ſome of their Saints, buried. In the flouriſhing days of <hi>Egypt</hi> there were above three hundred and ſixty Tombs, and
<hi>Moſques</hi> of Great Men; every one endowed with a ſufficient allowance for poor People, and the Pilgrims of that Religion that came thither. So that a Pilgrim, at <hi>Cairo,</hi> could have ſubſiſted a whole year without ſpending an <hi>Aſper,</hi> by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting every day the
<hi>Moſques</hi> and Tombs of this <pb n="82" facs="tcp:106091:45"/>place; but in proceſs of time the Revenues being devoured, by the wickedneſs of the
<hi>Pacha's,</hi> the Tombs and <hi>Moſques</hi> are ſince gone to decay.</p>

                  <head>The way of Hatching Chickens at <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The 21ſt of this Month I went to ſee the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens where the Chickens are hatched. Theſe Ovens are builded in the ſame manner as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of <hi>France,</hi> made to bake Bread, only with this difference; they are not ſo high, nor ſo big as ours, nor of burnt Brick, but of Brick dried in the Sun. They have alſo, on the top, a round hole, as big as the circumference of a <hi>French</hi> Hat, through which the heat mounts up and goes out, which Ovens for Bread have not.</p>
                  <p>In the Houſe where I ſaw them, they were plac'd in this manner. There were four and twenty: twelve on the right hand, and twelve on the left; ſix one upon another. At the firſt ſight one would have thought them to be ſo many Sleeping-cells of Monks: but the Alley that was between
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106091:45"/>was ſo narrow, that when I enter'd in, the ſmoak and heat that came out had almoſt ſtifled me.</p>
                  <p>Now, to cauſe the Egs to be hatch'd, they put them all in the lowermoſt Ovens; and in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt they kindle a ſmall Fire, for eight days, with Straw. Afterwards they ſtop them, and leave them ſo ſix other days: Then they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Egs from the lowermoſt Ovens, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the good from the bad, by examining them in the Sun-ſhine. Afterwards they caſt away the addled, and put all the good in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Ovens; making, with Straw, a ſmall Fire in the lowermoſt, for two days. They leave them in that condition one and twenty days, without medling with them: at which time the Chickens begin to break the Shell; ſo that in two and twenty days they bring forth Chickens in this manner.</p>
                  <p>This is not to be practis'd, but during four Months in the Year; namely, from the Month of <hi>December,</hi> till the Month of <hi>April:</hi> The other part of the Year is not fit for this purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the exceſſive heats.</p>

                  <head>Of the <hi>Pyramides.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN my firſt Voyage to <hi>Egypt</hi> I had ſeen the
<hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramides;</hi> but, having another opportunity offer'd to me, I went thither to view again theſe rare Monuments of Antiquity, to ſee whether I might not obſerve ſomething more than I have taken notice of in my firſt Relation.</p>
                  <p>On the 27th of <hi>April</hi> I went thither, in the Company of the <hi>French</hi> Conſul, and many other <pb n="84" facs="tcp:106091:46"/>Merchants, and with almoſt all his Houſhold: we had with us three <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> to guard us, ſo that we were in all about fifty Cavaliers, well mounted upon Aſſes; taking with us Proviſions ſufficient for three days.</p>
                  <p>When we were come to the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> and had obſerv'd exactly every thing: I took notice that the place where they ſtood was a Burying-place. This is plain to any that ſee the place; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it was the burying-place of the old City <hi>Memphis;</hi> for all the
<hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtories inform us, that this City ſtood where the
<hi>Pyramides</hi> now are, over againſt Old <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I took notice that all the <hi>Pyramides</hi> have an entrance that leads to a low Alley, which is very long; and at the end is a Chamber, where the ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> did place the Bodies of thoſe Perſons, for whom the <hi>Pyramides</hi> was built. This entrance is not to be ſeen in every one of the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> becauſe the Wind hath ſtopt them with Sand. I ſaw upon ſome of them ſome
<hi>Hierogliphick</hi> Characters, but I had not time to write them out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I took notice that all the <hi>Pyramides</hi> were builded in very good order; and that each of the three greateſt were at the head of ten leſſer, which are not well to be diſtinguiſhed, becauſe of the heaps of Sand: one may yet imagine, to ſee the place, that in former Ages there have been here one hundred <hi>Pyramides,</hi> little and great.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I took notice that they are all builded upon an even Rock, covered over with white Sand; ſo that it is very probable that the Stones have been taken from the place, and not brought from <pb n="85" facs="tcp:106091:46"/>far, as ſome Travellers imagine, and old Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: for the greateſt is nothing but a Rock cut as a <hi>Pyramide,</hi> and covered over with a Wall of Stone.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I took notice that of all the Stones of the greateſt, there is ſcarce one entire, but either worn out with the Weather and Time, or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ſome other Accident; ſo that, though one may aſcend on all ſides to the top, yet not in all places with the ſame eaſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I have taken notice that none of the
<hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides</hi> are alike, or perfectly ſquare; but that all have two ſides longer than the others. I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meaſure the greateſt: for that purpoſe I had with me a String of about thirty Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards; but becauſe the Winds have heap'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it Mountains of Sand, I could not poſſibly draw a Line ſtrait from one Angle to the other.</p>
                  <p>On the 28th day of <hi>December</hi> I went to ſee the
<hi>Pyramides</hi> the third time, with ſome ſtrangers. In our way we were mightily troubled with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thick Miſt, which laſted till ten a Clock in the Morning; and we found a great deal of Mud in the Trenches and Ditches, which was not yet dry ſince the retreat of the River; ſo that we were carried over upon the <hi>Moors</hi> backs that were with us.</p>
                  <p>At this time I went up to the top of the great
<hi>Pyramide;</hi> and I obſerv'd, as at the firſt, that the place where the <hi>Pyramides</hi> ſtand, is a pure Rock, cover'd over with white Sand; which appears ſufficiently by the Ditches and Caves round about the
<hi>Pyramides</hi> cut in the Rock.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Rock is to be ſeen, upon which ſtands the greateſt <hi>Pyramide,</hi> by a hole at one of the <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106091:47"/>Angles, between the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and the <hi>North</hi> ſides.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Pyramides</hi> are not builded with Marble, as ſome ſay; but with a white ſandy Stone, very hard.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The greateſt hath but two hundred and ſix ſteps; and though Monſieur <hi>Th.</hi> ſaith that it hath two hundred and eight, this proceeds from his not taking notice that two ſteps are broken into four.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. On the top of the greateſt <hi>Pyramide</hi> there was anciently a Statue, or <hi>Coloſſe.</hi> This appears, becauſe it is not ſharp as the others, but plain: And there are yet to be ſeen great Pits, which were to keep faſt the <hi>Coloſſe</hi> from falling.</p>
                  <p>At preſent there is nothing on the top but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Letters of the Names of Perſons or all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who have left them to witneſs that they had been there. There is no ſign of the Play at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala,</hi> which a <hi>Coptie</hi> told me was there imprinted in the days of the
<hi>Pharaoh's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Stones of the biggeſt <hi>Pyramide</hi> are not equal; for ſome of the undermoſt are four Foot high, ſome three Foot and an half, and five Foot long. The Stones of the middle are three Foot and five Inches high, and the uppermoſt Stones are but two Foot high, and three and an half long.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſides of the <hi>Pyramides</hi> are not equal; for in the greateſt it is viſible, and ſo in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the
<hi>North</hi>-ſide is longer than that which ſtretches from
<hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. In all the <hi>Pyramides</hi> there are very deep Wells cut in the Rock, ſquare; as I have ſeen in more than ten.</p>
                  <p>On the 26th day of <hi>June</hi> I went the fourth time
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106091:47"/>to ſee the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> in the Company of Monſieur <hi>Sabatery,</hi> Vice-Conſul of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Paſſage to Old <hi>Cairo,</hi> on the other ſide of the River, I took notice of one thing very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in its Channel: The Water was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly green, as a Cake covered over with green Graſs. This was the firſt time that I ſaw it of this colour; which cauſed me to ask of the Boat-men, what this green colour was? They told me, tint the River
<hi>Nilus</hi> did then putrifie, that it had continued ſo fifteen days, and would be ſo five more. Some of them ſaid, that there was none could remember to have ſeen the River ſo green as that year, 1672.</p>
                  <p>To return again to the <hi>Pyramides:</hi> I went up this time to the top of the higheſt <hi>Pyramide:</hi> I enter'd into the Chamber, but ſaw no new thing which could cauſe me either to change, or add to my former Obſervations. It is needleſs to ſpeak of its Dimenſions, ſeeing ſo many Travellers have already publiſh'd them, as Monſieur <hi>Thevenot</hi> in his <hi>Levant</hi> Travels.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Pyramides</hi> we went to take a view of the Caves that are adjoining. There are many, all cut in the ſide of a Rock: Their out-ſides are out of order, without any proportion; but their in-ſide very equal, and polliſh'd. In every one there is a deep Well ſquare, cut in the Rock, where the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did put the Body of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for whom the Cave was made; for it was their Sepulchre. The walls of many of theſe Caves are full of Hieroglyphick Figures, carved in the Rock. In ſome they are but ſmall, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers very lively. In one I number'd ſixteen great Figures, that repreſented eight Men and eight <pb n="88" facs="tcp:106091:48"/>Women, holding one another by the hands; with many other ſmall Figures, or Shapes, on both ſides.</p>

                  <p>WE ſaw next the <hi>Sphinx,</hi> near the <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides,</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide. On the top ſtands the Head of a Woman of an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bigneſs and height. The <hi>Arabians</hi> call it
<hi>Abul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,</hi> or <hi>Abul-houl.</hi>

                     <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith that it was the Tomb of King
<hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi> I imagine that this <hi>Sphinx</hi> was a Sepulchre, but we cannot underſtand that it belong'd to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> for all the Records and Traditions of this <hi>Sphinx</hi> are loſt.</p>
                  <p>That it is a Tomb may appear, Firſt by its ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, which is in a place which was in former Ages a Burying-place; and near the
<hi>Pyramides,</hi> and mortuary Caves. Secondly it is to be imagined that it was a Sepulchre from its building. In the hinder part is a Cave under ground, of a bigneſs anſwerable to that of the Head, into which I have look'd by an entrance that leads into it; ſo that it could ſerve to no other purpoſe but to keep a dead Corps.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Francs</hi> have, out of an exceſs of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, climb'd up by the means of Rope-Ladders, to ſee whether this Head was hollow, or maſſie; and they have found it to be hollow, but filled at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with Sand.</p>
                  <p>The Neck is worn out round about, which cauſeth Men to imagine that it will not be able to ſupport the weight of that great Head.</p>

                  <head>Of the Wells where the <hi>Mommies</hi> are.</head>
                  <p>WHen we had fully viewed this <hi>Sphinx,</hi> we took the Road that leads to <hi>Saccára,</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, at four hours travelling from the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> and about eight from <hi>Cairo</hi> towards the
<hi>South.</hi> The Burying-place of the <hi>Mommies</hi> is near adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Village.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe it was very late, and that we were to agree with the <hi>Arabians</hi> of the Village about the Price, the Number and Quality of the Wells that they were to open for us. We ſtopt there all Night, and the next Morning we took with us twelve Horſe-men, to Guard us, of the
<hi>Arabians;</hi> with them we went to this Burying-place, where the
<hi>Mommies</hi> are in Caves under ground.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Well that we ſaw was that of Birds Embalmed. When we had cauſed the Sand that ſtops the Wells Mouth to be removed, through which we were to go down, and from thence to enter into the Cave; we cauſed our ſelves to be let down one after another, by tying a double Rope about our middles. As ſoon as we were at the bottom, and that every one had lighted his Taper, and ſeveral Matches that we had brought, we went into the Cave creeping upon our Bellies. The Cave is an Alley in the Rock, about the height of a Man, and about the breadth of a Perch; and of an extraordinary length. We found there many other Alleys on both hands, cut in the Rock; where were many large ſtores, full of Earthen Pots, covered over with Coverings of the ſame ſubſtance. In theſe Pots were Embalmed Birds <pb n="90" facs="tcp:106091:49"/>of all kinds, every Bird in its own Pot. And as I thought that the remembrance of a Cuſtom ſo ancient, and ſuperſtitious, was worthy of our notice, I brought about half a dozen with me; ſome I have ſent to the King's Library. We found alſo ſome Hens Egs, empty, but entire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ill ſmell or crack.</p>
                  <p>When we had viewed ſufficiently this Cave, we returned up in the ſame manner that we went down, and found another open'd, called the Virgin; which is, that was never open'd before: According to our orders to the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Tiger</hi> and the others went down in the ſame manner as into the former; I alone could not follow them, becauſe of a
<hi>Quartain</hi> Fever which had troubled me fourteen months, and took me at that very Moment: But I loſt nothing by that: for theſe Gentlemen told me at their return, that they found an horrid ſtench, and a cloſe air, that put out their Candles, and their Matches alſo, every time that they endeavour'd to light them; which cauſed them to get up again without entring further. They told me that this Well was much deeper than the former.</p>
                  <p>We cauſed another to be open'd, which was not a Virgin Well, as the former, becauſe it was not ſo deep. I ventur'd into that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my indiſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>We found there two <hi>Mommies,</hi> a great one, and a little one of a Child, both in Coffins, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt was of Marble; upon the Covering it had the likeneſs of the Perſon for whom it was made: We caus'd theſe Biers, or Coffins, to be open'd, but found nothing extraordinary; therefore we made no account of them, and left them where we found them.</p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:106091:49"/>
                  <p>We went down next into a Cave, called <hi>The Church,</hi> which was not ſo deep as the former. It was nothing but a long Alley under ground, well Plaiſter'd, and Painted all over with Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Figures round about the ſides. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all full of Sand, which cauſed us to creep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long upon our Knees.</p>
                  <p>If the Reader deſires a Proſpect, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this ancient Burying-place, let him think upon a boundleſs Champain, even and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with Sand; where neither Trees, nor Graſs, nor Houſes, nor any ſuch thing is to be ſeen: Let him repreſent to himſelf the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this large Field full of dry Bones of Arms, Legs, Feet, and Heads; full of ſcattered pieces of Wood of Coffins, of little Idols, ſome of Wood, others of Plaiſter embolliſh'd with green, and mark'd before and behind with Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Letters. Theſe Idols the <hi>Arabians</hi> have taken from the broken <hi>Mommies</hi> which they have caſt away. In ſome places you may ſee great Tomb-ſtones, full of Cyphers and enigmatical Figures that repreſent ſomething of Chymiſtry, and of other Sciences and Myſteries; and full of ſtrange Characters that are no Hieroglyphicks. Whiles I was looking upon this Spectacle the <hi>Arabians</hi> brought me two, whereof I cauſed the Coppies to be drawn as ſoon as I was returned to
<hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have here a Deſcription of ſome Relicks of the Grandeur and Vanity of the ancient <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and the mournful ſigns of Man's Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The firſt ſight is able to daſh a Perſon newly arrived, out of Countenance, and to affright him: I mean the ſight of ſo many Bones all ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <pb n="92" facs="tcp:106091:50"/>up and down, one would think that here hath been a grievous fight.</p>
                  <p>In this Champain, or Field, here are fifteen <hi>Pyramides:</hi> three are of an extraordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſeem to have been favour'd by Time; for they appear entire without much decay. Here is alſo an entrance in every one, that ſhews a long Alley which leads to a Chamber; Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Tiger</hi> went into that which is fartheſt from the Village, commonly named <hi>The Pyramide of Rodope,</hi> where he found nothing in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Pyramide</hi> is built as a Pavillion. The
<hi>Francs</hi> ſay that <hi>Rodope,</hi> a famous Strumpet, caus'd it to be built with the Money that ſhe had gotten with the loſs of her honour. But this is doubtleſs an error, if it be true what <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, That the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramide</hi> of <hi>Rodope</hi> was but ſmall, though very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; therefore this which is one of the greateſt in all <hi>Egypt</hi> cannot be that of <hi>Rodope.</hi> Theſe are the words of <hi>Pliny: Supremumque illud ne quis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum opes miretur, minimam extitiſſe laudatiſſimam à Rodope meretricula factam. Aeſopi fabularum Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophi conſerva quondam, &amp; contubernalis haec fuit, majore miraculo tantas opes meretricio eſſe conquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas quaeſtu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the others that are in the ſame Field, Time hath almoſt worn them out; for they are but ſo many heaps of Sand, which have ſcarce the ſhape and ſhadow of what they have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
                  <p>Here is alſo a ſquare heap of very great hewn Stones. The
<hi>Arabians</hi> name it <hi>Maſtabet Faraoun:</hi> for they ſay, that when the <hi>Pharaoh's,</hi> Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were to declare and give a new <pb n="93" facs="tcp:106091:50"/>Law to to the People, they ſtood on the top of this heap. But theſe are the Traditions of the poor <hi>Arabians</hi> that have nothing of certainty.</p>
                  <p>To return to the Wells of the <hi>Mommies:</hi> as ſoon as the
<hi>Francs</hi> have viſited any, the Wind, or the <hi>Arabians,</hi> fill the entry again full of Sand, to get a little Money at the ſecond opening. This is the greateſt gain of theſe Wretches. The leaſt they take for to open a Virgin Well is thirty <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters,</hi> becauſe they that make the Well to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, have the liberty to carry away all the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities and
<hi>Mommies</hi> that he finds there.</p>
                  <p>We return'd, after two days abſence, to the City
<hi>Cairo</hi> again; and the 6th of <hi>May</hi> I went to viſit the
<hi>Greek</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> who was then reſident at <hi>Cairo</hi> about ſome concerns of his Monaſtery. Amongſt other things, he told me that he had a Manuſcript of the Council of
<hi>Florence,</hi> differing from all thoſe Copies that are Printed in
<hi>Europe.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Tiger</hi> hath a Copy of this ſuppoſed Original.</p>
                  <p>The Monks of this Monaſtery have a priviledge from
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſigned according to the Cuſtome of that time by the impreſſion of his Hand, which frees them from the <hi>Carach,</hi> or Tax, which the <hi>Mahometans</hi> require of the Chriſtians ſubject to them. This was the cauſe wherefore <hi>Mahomet</hi> granted them this favour, as the Arch-Biſhop told me, to expreſs his thanks to that Houſe for the kind entertainment which he had received at the hands of thoſe Monks when he kept, and watch'd over their Camels.</p>
                  <p>We diſcours'd afterwards concerning the Plague of the former Year. He told me, that it had ſwept away ſix hundred and fourſcore thouſand <pb n="94" facs="tcp:106091:51"/>Perſons, but that it had ſcarce medled with any but the poor; and that of the richer fort ſcarce four hundred were dead.</p>
                  <p>This cauſeth me to ſpeak a word of Father <hi>Elzear</hi> of
<hi>Nants,</hi> a very worthy Perſon; and his Comrade, Father
<hi>Portais;</hi> both of the <hi>Capuchin</hi> Order, and zealous
<hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> whom this Plague carried away. The firſt was buried out of the City <hi>Cairo,</hi> in a Field where the poor
<hi>Copies</hi> are buried, for whoſe Converſion he was intended.</p>
                  <p>To honour the Memory of his Vertues, there is an Epitaph in
<hi>Arab.</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> upon a little Stone fixed upon his Grave; and becauſe I was well acquainted with him in my firſt Voyage which I made into <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the Orders and Commands of <hi>Erneſt,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Saxa-Gota,</hi> in the Year 1664. I went to ſee his Grave, and to repeat for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his Soul, and as a Teſtimony of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and eſteem of his rare Qualities, the Prayer <hi>De profundis.</hi>

                  <head>A Journy to <hi>Gemiane.</hi>

                  <p>WHen the time was come that the <hi>Copties</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Feſtival of the Aparitions of the Saints at <hi>Gemiane;</hi> becauſe I had not ſeen it in my firſt Voyage, I went from <hi>Cairo</hi> on
<hi>Monday</hi> the 9th of <hi>May,</hi> with a Servant of Monſieur <hi>de Tiger,</hi> named <hi>Leonard,</hi> that could Paint very well, with ſeveral
<hi>Copties</hi> who came in our Company, becauſe they had nothing to diſcharge the expence of this Journy. We went aboard at <hi>Boulac,</hi> and ſet ſail for the Town of <hi>Manſoura,</hi> where we landed the 12th of the ſame Month.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:106091:51"/>
                  <p>The next day we left <hi>Manſoura,</hi> taking a Boat for
<hi>Diaſt,</hi> a little Village ſcituate upon the <hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Niltus;</hi> for here all Travellers that go to <hi>Gemiane</hi> from
<hi>Cairo</hi> are wont to land. It ſtands about four hours journying from
<hi>Manſoura.</hi> At our landing we left our Boat and went by Land to
<hi>Boſſat inoſſára,</hi> a little Mile diſtant from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in the Land; we ſpent there the Night, and lodg'din the Church of S.
<hi>George,</hi> with ſeveral other <hi>Copties</hi> whom we found there, who were bound alſo, as well as we, for <hi>Gemiane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 14th day very early we proceeded on towards the third branch of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, as I have already ſaid in the Deſcription of this River, at <hi>Sciobret il Yemen;</hi> which it hath paſs'd near the Town of <hi>Mohelle Kebíre,</hi> or Great <hi>Mohelle,</hi> and near
<hi>Gemiane</hi> it diſcharges it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea at <hi>Brullos.</hi> We march'd on into the Country, and when we came to this Branch of the River we found ſeveral Boats ready to carry us with the Current to <hi>Gemiane,</hi> where we land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Evening, not without ſuffering many croſſes, and inconveniences; becauſe the Maſter of the Boat, an <hi>Arabian,</hi> was a wicked Rogue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gemiane</hi> is a famous Church of the <hi>Copties,</hi> built in a large Champain; very even and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the Eye, but very unfruitful, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Garbie</hi> in the Iſle of
<hi>Delta.</hi> It ſtands near the place where was anciently the City
<hi>Degue,</hi> called by the <hi>Copties Tekebi.</hi> On the <hi>Weſt</hi> it hath the Great <hi>Mohelle,</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> the Branch of the River that enters into the Sea at <hi>Brullos,</hi> and on the <hi>North</hi> the Mediteranean Sea. This Church hath five and twenty Arches, or Iſles, that yield at a diſtance a very beautiful Proſpect, <pb n="96" facs="tcp:106091:52"/>though they be not in order nor equal in bigneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Church within is not yet finiſh'd, and there is but one Chappel whited with Lime, namely that where the ſuppoſed Apparition happens: there is alſo but one Altar, as in all other Churches of the
<hi>Levant.</hi> All the Iles, or Arches, ſerve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Church, and to give light to it; for in every one there is a Window, and in ſome two. The Chappel where the Apparition happens is on the <hi>North</hi>-ſide, on the right hand as one enters in, and over againſt the Door.</p>
                  <p>During three days I examin'd this Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the cauſes from whence it proceeds as exactly as I could poſſibly; and found it to be nothing elſe but the reflection of the Objects that went by the Church at a convenient diſtance, which being carried into the Chappel, by the Air, through the two Windows that give light. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents, over againſt upon the Wall, the Shadow which is like the Object that goes by: For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; when a Horſe-man goes by, there is to be ſeen upon the Wall, in a confuſed manner, a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a Man on Horſe-back. If it be a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath a Child in her Arms, one may ſee the Shadow of that appearance; and ſo is it with all other things. Now the People being ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and of a dull apprehenſion, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how this happens, fancy that the Saints ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them.</p>
                  <p>They know and diſtinguiſh them, according as they are painted in their Churches: For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they ſee the Shadow that repreſents a Cavalier, they ſay that it is S. <hi>George;</hi> for the
<hi>Copties,</hi> as well as the other People of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> repreſent him as a Man on Horſe-back, killing a <pb n="97" facs="tcp:106091:52"/>Dragon. When they ſee a Woman carrying of an Infant in her Arms, they ſay that it is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, becauſe they ſee her thus repreſented in the Pictures of their Churches. When they ſee the Shadow of a Man on foot of a reddiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they ſay that it is S. <hi>Menna,</hi> becauſe they paint him with a red Habit. They diſtinguiſh the other Saints in the ſame manner. They are ſo much bewitch'd with the fancy of the reality of theſe Apparitions, that if any Perſon ſhould offer to deny it, he would be in danger to be knock'd on the head.</p>
                  <p>It is in vain to anſwer that the Shadows that appear in this Chappel cannot be formed by the reflection of the Objects, becauſe the Windows, through which they come in, are at the <hi>North</hi>-ſide of the Church which never enjoys the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine; and that therefore they be true and real Apparitions.</p>
                  <p>To this I reply, that it is not needful that the Church be enlighten'd on that ſide; but it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that the Objects that paſs by be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd. Now if the Church had the light of the Sun on that ſide, the brightneſs of the light would diſcover too plainly the Shadows, and would take away all cauſes of admiration.</p>
                  <p>If any will ſay that ſome ingenious Perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them hath built this Chappel, according to the Rules of the Optick Art, to deceive the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with theſe Apparitions; I deſire him to take notice that the
<hi>Copties</hi> are ſo ignorant that they know not what this Art is. This Chappel, as the other Churches, hath been built in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner without any deſign to cozen the World; therefore this Reflection, which they name Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition <pb n="98" facs="tcp:106091:53"/>of the Saints, hath been diſcover'd by chance. Experience hath taught me this in other Churches which have not been builded no more than this to deceive the World with vain Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions. I have taken notice of it in the Church <hi>Boſſat inoſſára,</hi> where I was on the 13th of the ſame Month, in the company of ſome
<hi>Copties</hi> that were going to <hi>Gemiane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> There I ſaw the ſame Shadows, which two days after at <hi>Gemiane,</hi> they called S.
<hi>George,</hi> the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and S. <hi>Menna;</hi> ſo that when the <hi>Copties</hi> perceived them they knew not what to ſay. By this we may judge, that this Church hath not been built by the Optick Rules of Art, and that only by chance theſe Shadows have appeared, and been taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>This Apparition continues three days follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in which time there is ſuch a great concourſe of People, that one is ready to be ſtifled. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they did call every Saint according to their devotion and reſpect, without order: And when they ſaw ſome Shadows upon the Wall which had a relation with thoſe Saints that are painted in their Churches, they cry out for joy, in their Language, <hi>Selam lak Kaddis Filan; I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you ô Saint N. N.</hi> To this they add an Hymn proper to the Saint, and Prayers, tying upon the Wall ſome little croſſes of Wax. Of all the Saints that their Church worſhips, I have heard none called upon but the bleſſed Virgin, S. <hi>George,</hi> S. <hi>Menna,</hi> and S.
<hi>Porter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On this Feſtival day all the <hi>Arabians</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts meet here, out of an ancient Cuſtome, to be treated for three days with the Revenues of this Church: When I was there, they could make up near five hundred Horſe, and five hundred <pb n="99" facs="tcp:106091:53"/>Foot. The Horſe-men were Armed with a Lance, the Foot-men with a Club upon their Shoulders, pointed with Iron.</p>
                  <p>This Cuſtome of feeding the <hi>Arabians</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts is very ancient; it comes from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be the Lords of the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout where this Church is built, and therefore for this conſideration they hinder not the Chriſtians, as they are able, from coming to this Feſtival.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the <hi>Epitrope,</hi> or Treaſurer of the Church, hath care to provide all things needful for their entertainment. He kill'd that year ſeven young Cows, two every day: He provided for them Rice, Bread, and Barly for their Cattel: He had a care alſo to ſend for Cooks, and all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements neceſſary for a Kitchin; ſo that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> had nothing elſe to do here, but to eat and drink and divert themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Twice every every day, theſe <hi>Arabians</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their War-like Exerciſes, to ſhew their jolly humor, and to give ſport to the Aſſembly. The Horſe-men played at <hi>Girit,</hi> or the Dart, by caſting it to one another, riding one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fencing therewith with much dexterity: The Footmen likewiſe skirmiſh'd one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother very pleaſantly with their great Staves.</p>
                  <p>The third day of this Feſtival the <hi>Arabians</hi> have nothing given them but a Dinner, as ſoon as they have eaten it they are to depart; ſo that if two hours after any of them was found there, and that the
<hi>Beys</hi> Lieutenant hath any knowledge of him; he will cauſe him to be puniſh'd, either by the Purſe, or a Baſtinado: ſo that none have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſtay there that day, but Chriſtians whom the <hi>Epitrope</hi> treats in the ſame manner as he doth the <hi>Arabians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:106091:54"/>
                  <p>I was one of the chief Perſons invited, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer entertained me under his own tent with an extraordinary Banquet, only Wine was wanting; and Spoons, Forks, Knives and Napkins were not uſed: The Meat was to be torn in pieces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fingers, according to the Cuſtome of the Country. Afterwards, out of the Tent, a long Skin of Leather was ſpread upon the ground for the ordinary People, where they were very well treated. I ſhall finiſh this Relation with an advice to all <hi>Francs</hi> that intend to ſee this Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. They ought to take the ſame Way as we have done, becauſe it is the eaſieſt, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and the leſs dangerous. Let them get a good Tent; for there are no Lodgings, but in the open Air: Let them carry Wine, Strong-waters, Meat, Hens, Bread, and other things for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment during the Feſtival: Let them alſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them the Furniture of the Table, a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, a Cuſhion to ſit upon, and ſome Coverlets for their conveniency, and to appear handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Water and Wood, are here plenty: There is Fiſh alſo to be ſold; for the Fiſher-men of
<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> that is near adjoining, bring hither a great deal. I was provided with all theſe things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I appeared very decently.</p>
                  <p>There is here no danger of being robb'd; for the Lieutenant of the <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Mohelle</hi> is alſo at this Feſtival with a good Guard of <hi>Spahins,</hi> to prevent Diſorders, Quarrels, and Robberies which might happen among rude and barbarous People: So that in this place one may be with as much ſafety as at <hi>Cairo</hi> in a Houſe. Upon this account there happen'd a pleaſant Accident; a poor <hi>Arabian</hi> had taken from a Chriſtian a handful of Barly to give <pb n="101" facs="tcp:106091:54"/>it to his Aſs, he was taken upon the Fact: The Chriſtians immediately dragg'd him with a great noiſe, to the <hi>Beys</hi> Lieutenant to have him puniſh'd: Whiles they were leading him a great Tumult of People ran to ſee him; ſome upbraided him with his boldneſs and impudency to ſteal, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the puniſhment of the Saints that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in their Church, and did ſo many great Miracles; another ask'd him whether he did not fear that God would puniſh him? At which words he anſwer'd, <hi>Ane Baaref rabbene;</hi> that is, <hi>What, do I know that there is a God?</hi> or, <hi>I know not what is God.</hi> This cauſed me to wonder, both at the
<hi>Copties</hi> ſettled perſwaſion of the real Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of their Saints, and at the ignorance of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> ſeeing that ſome of them know not that there is a God. At laſt this Wretch was ſhut up in a Cage, and I know not what happen'd to him afterwards.</p>
                  <p>It is time to prepare to depart when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany withdraws it ſelf; and if one deſires to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Cairo</hi> by another way, one may go by Land to <hi>Brullos,</hi> from thence to <hi>Roſetta;</hi> by this means one may go through the lower part of <hi>Delta:</hi> a curious Journy which I never heard that any <hi>Franc</hi> hath made. But in caſe any danger is likely to be in this way, one may go from <hi>Gemiane</hi> to Great
<hi>Mohelle,</hi> where the ways are full of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and from thence one may go by Land to <hi>Cairo,</hi> and ſee all the Antiquities that be in
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helle</hi> and all along the wav.</p>
                  <p>I went away on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> morning when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was departing, and returned to <hi>Cairo</hi> the ſame way that I came, becauſe the other ways ſeem'd to be dangerous. I arrived at <hi>Cairo</hi> the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106091:55"/>20th of the ſame Month, eleven days after my departure.</p>
                  <p>The Repreſentation of this Church is in the Cabinet of Monſieur <hi>C.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 27th of <hi>May</hi> I went to viſit the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of the <hi>Copties,</hi> called <hi>Muallim Mattaos,</hi> or Maſter
<hi>Matthew,</hi> whom I had ſeen in my firſt Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. I intreated him to give me a Letter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me to the Monaſteries of Saint
<hi>Macari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whither I intended to go, which he granted me very willingly.</p>
                  <p>The 30th of this Month a <hi>Bey</hi> of
<hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> arrived at <hi>Cairo,</hi> bound for the Iſland of
<hi>Suaquen,</hi> ſcituated in the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> where he was to Govern as <hi>Pacha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ſame time came <hi>Don Pietro,</hi> an
<hi>Abyſſin,</hi> whom I had known at <hi>Rome,</hi> and who had given me the Manuſcripts of the Synods, and the Old Teſtament written in the
<hi>Ethiopian</hi> Language. He, and another of the ſame Nation named
<hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> went with this <hi>Pacha,</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to get into their own Country. I heard ſome time after that this <hi>Pietro</hi> was become a <hi>Mahometan</hi> at <hi>Sues,</hi> to eſcape the Fire unto which he was condemn'd for ſtriking a

                  <head>A Voyage to <hi>Roſetta.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ON <hi>Monday</hi> the laſt of <hi>May,</hi> I went out of
<hi>Cairo</hi> deſigned for <hi>Roſetta,</hi> with the ſame
<hi>Leonard</hi> who had been with me at <hi>Gemiane,</hi> and a
<hi>Nubian</hi> Slave that I had. I went thither on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſpend there the time of the violent heats, which are not ſo fierce in that City as at
<hi>Cairo;</hi> 
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:106091:55"/>as alſo to ſee the Mouth of the River
<hi>Nilus</hi> at that City, and to ſatisfie a doubt that I had about the Water, of <hi>Maadíe;</hi> for I knew not whether it was a Gulph, or a Mouth of the River <hi>Nilus:</hi> with an intention from thence to go to
<hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> to ſee its Curioſities.</p>
                  <p>We were four days going from <hi>Cairo</hi> to
<hi>Roſetta;</hi> an extraordinary long time, becauſe the winds
<hi>Maltam,</hi> or <hi>Maeſtraux,</hi> that blow againſt thoſe that go down the River, oppoſed our Voyage.</p>
                  <p>The moſt remarkable Towns in this way are, <hi>Fuva, Sindiun, Teirut, Motubis,</hi> and <hi>Tféni,</hi> by the River ſide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fuva,</hi> called by the <hi>Greeks Metelis,</hi> and in the
<hi>Copties</hi> Dictionary <hi>Meſſil,</hi> is a very ancient, great, and conſiderable Town, ſcituated upon the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of
<hi>Nilus,</hi> ſeven hours travelling from <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetta.</hi> Its Territory is very delightful, becauſe of the pleaſant Fields and Gardens round about. It bears Fruits that are much eſteem'd in all
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Geziret Iddahab,</hi> or <hi>the Iſland of Gold,</hi> is over againſt this City.</p>
                  <p>Heretofore the River was ſo deep from the Mouth as far as this Town, that great Barques loaden were able to ſail hither; at that time the Cuſtom-houſe was kept here. But in time the River becoming here ſo ſhallow that the Barques being not able to come ſo far, the Cuſtom-houſe hath been ſince eſtabliſh'd at <hi>Roſetta,</hi> where it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues yet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sindiun</hi> and <hi>Teirut</hi> are two other Towns ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upon the Banks of <hi>Nilus</hi> over againſt one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; as are alſo <hi>Motúbis</hi> and <hi>Tféni:</hi> the firſt ſtands on the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide, the other on the
<hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:106091:56"/>
                  <p>At <hi>Roſetta</hi> I lodged with Monſieur <hi>Reynaud,</hi> Vice-Conſul of the <hi>French</hi> in this City; he is a very honeſt Man: He imployed all his credit to procure me the ſight of the Curioſities round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
                  <p>For the information of all <hi>European</hi> Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, I have taken notice that of late there is a Carrier ſet up at <hi>Roſetta,</hi> who goes by Land to <hi>Damietta,</hi> when any deſires to travel that way, which conveniency was not formerly; for when any intended that Journey, he was to run many hazards and inconveniences. I had firſt deſign'd to go thither, but inſtead of that Journey I went to viſit the Monaſteries of the Deſart of S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius,</hi> where I expected more ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>I have long doubted whether the Waters of
<hi>Maadíe,</hi> or the Pool, that is half-way between
<hi>Roſetta</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> was a Branch of <hi>Nilus,</hi> or elſe a Gulph of the Sea. In another Relation of <hi>Egypt</hi> which I Printed in <hi>Italian</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year 1671. I have ſaid that it was a Branch of <hi>Nilus;</hi> but ſince I have underſtood the truth that it was nothing but a Gulph, or Pool: for, 1. Its Waters are very ſalt as far as <hi>Etku,</hi> its uttermoſt bounds; which Town, as I conceive, is the ſame with <hi>Motubis.</hi> 2. This Water comes not from
<hi>Nilus,</hi> neither hath any Correſpondency with this River. True it is, when <hi>Nilus</hi> overflows it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſweeter, becauſe of the mixture of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's-water with the Water of this Gulph. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains this ſweetneſs about two Months, until <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> leaves the Fields; and as ſoon as the <hi>Tramon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> or <hi>Weſterly</hi> Wind blows, the Waters of this Pool return to their wonted ſaltneſs and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:106091:56"/>
                  <p>The 10th of <hi>June</hi> I went to the Mouth of the River
<hi>Nilus,</hi> about an hours ſailing from <hi>Roſetta,</hi> to take the Deſcription of it.</p>
                  <p>I took notice that <hi>Nilus</hi> hath there two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or Mouths, though they be reckoned but one. That which runs into the Sea towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and is called the <hi>Eaſterly Mouth;</hi> and that which runs into the Sea towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and is named the
<hi>Weſterly Mouth.</hi> They take the firſt to ſail to <hi>Brullos,</hi> to <hi>Damietta,</hi> to <hi>Seyda,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, &amp;c</hi> and by this laſt they go to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and other
<hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts. This ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceeds from a low Iſland, very ſmall, which ſtands in the middle of the River next to the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Mouth of <hi>Nilus</hi> next to this City, is Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with two Caſtles; one ſtands at the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of the River, and the other at the <hi>Weſt.</hi> That which is about a Mile and a half from
<hi>Roſetta</hi> is ſquare, encompaſſed about with ſtrong Walls, built according to the old Model, having four Towers. In the middle is a high Dungeon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat at laſt. One hundred fourſcore and four
<hi>Janiſſaries</hi> are there in Gariſon. They lye every Night in the Gariſon, but in the Day-time they have liberty to go into the City to work for their living. It is furniſh'd with threeſcore and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pieces of Cannon, ſeven are of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bigneſs. The <hi>Aga</hi> that Commanded here in chief, was a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Renegado.</p>
                  <p>The other Caſtle is but a <hi>Moſque,</hi> before it ſtands ſeven Pieces of Artillery on the Ground: Here Commands alſo an
<hi>Aga</hi> over a Company of <hi>Moors,</hi> who examine all that go in, or out of the City. When I attempted to go out, they came <pb n="106" facs="tcp:106091:57"/>to my Boat and obliged me to return into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again, though the
<hi>Janiſſary</hi> that was with me, and well acquainted with them, offered to anſwer for me. They treated me in this manner, for fear of a Pirat of
<hi>Malta</hi> that ſailed before the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at that time; they were afraid that I had ſome intelligence with him, to give him notice of ſome Ships that were ready to ſet ſail loaden from <hi>Roſetta:</hi> Nevertheleſs I had another opportunity to take the Deſcription of this Mouth alſo. It is now in the Cloſet of that Perſon of Quality who hath the others.</p>

                  <p>THE 14th of <hi>June</hi> I went, in the Evening, from
<hi>Roſetta</hi> towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with a <hi>Moor</hi> recommended to me by the <hi>French</hi> Vice-Conſul of this City: We had two Mules to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us, for which I paid ſeventeen <hi>Meidins</hi> for the whole Journy.</p>
                  <p>About Midnight we came to the Water, named by the <hi>Moors Maadíe.</hi> After a little ſtay in the <hi>Han,</hi> or publick Inn, we proceeded on in our Journey in a Moon-ſhining Night towards
<hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria;</hi> where we arriv'd the next day about eight or nine a Clock. From <hi>Roſetta</hi> to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> there is ten hours travelling for a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; the moſt part of the way is along the Sea-Coaſt, ſo that the Beaſts have a long way their Feet in Water.</p>
                  <p>The Country is ſo even, that there is no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Travellers; and unleſs it be the <hi>Han,</hi> 
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:106091:57"/>in the Mid-way, there is neither Village, nor Tree, nor Graſs to be ſeen: It is nothing but a plain Champain of Sand, altogether unfruitful.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Franc</hi> is bound to pay, at the entrance into
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> at the Gate of <hi>Roſetta,</hi> three <hi>Para's;</hi> half to the <hi>Beduins,</hi> or <hi>Boemiens,</hi> and half to the
<hi>Janiſſaries,</hi> becauſe they are there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Guard.</p>
                  <p>At my firſt arrival at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> on the 15th of the ſame Month, I went to ſalute Monſieur <hi>Laurens,</hi> Vice-Conſul in this City for the <hi>French;</hi> who expreſt a great deal of civility to me, and offered me his Table and a Chamber in his Houſe; but in regard I was recommended by Monſieur <hi>Brouſſon,</hi> the Factor of the
<hi>Levant</hi> Company, to Monſieur <hi>Sabatery,</hi> his intimate Friend, and Factor there, and in regard he had a convenient Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he offer'd me, to content them both I lodg'd with Monſieur <hi>Sabatery,</hi> and made uſe of the Vice-Conſul's Table all the time I ſtaid at
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went next to viſit an intimate Friend, with whom I had an acquaintance in my firſt Voyage to <hi>Egypt;</hi> he was called <hi>Komos Jean,</hi> Arch-Prieſt of the Church of S. <hi>Mark</hi> of the
<hi>Copties:</hi> He is an underſtanding, and an honeſt Man, and hath informed me much concerning the affairs of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I underſtood from the <hi>French</hi> Merchants of this City, that their <hi>Fondego</hi> hath been built by the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi>'s order for their Lodging; and ſince their eſtabliſhment in this City the
<hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Emperours</hi> were wont to pay to the <hi>French</hi> Conſuls ever Year two hundred Crowns for the Reparations of this Houſe, but of late they don't <pb n="108" facs="tcp:106091:58"/>ſee this Money: The cauſe is not well known.</p>
                  <p>On the 16th of this Month I went to a <hi>Jews</hi> Houſe, with an intention to buy of him a curious Hieroglyphick Stone that ſtands at the Threſhold of his Door. It is about an Ell and a-half long, and about a Foot broad, of a Marble colour; upon which are graven three lines of Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick Letters in very ſmall Characters, which are to be read from the left hand to the right.</p>
                  <p>This Stone was deſired by Monſieur <hi>Thevenot,</hi> who endeavoured to buy it; he offered, as I was told, thirty <hi>Piaſters</hi> to this <hi>Jew</hi> for it; but the other ask'd an hundred.</p>
                  <p>All the People of the <hi>Levant</hi> have this fooliſh Cuſtome to raiſe the Price of their Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; when they ſee that a
<hi>Franc</hi> deſires any thing, though it were but a trifle, the others deſire makes them think it to be unvaluable; they prize it therefore at ſuch a rate that none dare meddle with it: They are ſo ſimple to ſuffer the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to lie upon their Hands and ſpoil, rather than to ſell it to a <hi>Franc</hi> at the ſame rate that they would give it to a Man of the
<hi>Levant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs I expected that the <hi>Jew</hi> had chang'd his mind ſince that time; I offer'd him the ſame Price that this <hi>Franc</hi> had offer'd before: but when I ſaw that my offer render'd him more proud, reſolved in his firſt demand, I never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The Lodgings of the ſeventy Interpreters, who Tranſlated the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible into <hi>Greek,</hi> are yet ſtanding in this City, almoſt entire, with the Cloſets where they performed their Work. The

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106091:58"/>
                     <hi>Giama il garbíe,</hi> or the <hi>Moſque</hi> of the <hi>Levant.</hi> It is to be ſeen with Money: Monſieur
<hi>Brue,</hi> chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the <hi>French</hi> Conſul of
<hi>Cairo,</hi> hath gone in.</p>
                  <p>The 19th of <hi>June,</hi> being <hi>Saturday,</hi> I went to ſee the Salt-pits of the Grand <hi>Seignior,</hi> which are out of the City near the <hi>Calitz</hi> or <hi>Channel</hi> of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> from whence they have their Freſh-water when the River runs over the Banks, and near the Garden of a <hi>Moor</hi> often viſited by the <hi>French</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, which is call'd <hi>Gheit il chavagie,</hi> or <hi>the Merchants Garden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe Salt-pits I have taken notice of two things very remarkable: Firſt, that the Water of <hi>Nilus,</hi> the ſweeteſt Water and the freſheſt in the World, makes a Salt, not only whiter than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, but very excellent. Secondly, that this Salt hath the taſte of Violets.</p>
                  <p>They that have the care of thoſe Salt-pits cauſe a certain quantity of the River-water to run into the Salt-pits; and ſour or five days after the Water is turn'd into a Salt the moſt beautiful to the Eye, afterwards they carry it in Baskets to dry in the Sun; then it is fit to be ſold.</p>
                  <p>Salt is alſo to be made of the Lake <hi>Sebaka,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ancient <hi>Latins, Palus Mareotis,</hi> which is at the
<hi>South</hi>-ſide of this City; but its Water is naturally ſalt, and its Salt is bitter when it is made, therefore they neglect it.</p>
                  <p>This Lake proceeds from the River <hi>Nilus</hi> when it overflows; the Waters there continue, becauſe they have no paſſage out. It is not very deep, but ſo large that from one ſide one cannot well ſee the other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> have in their Church <pb n="110" facs="tcp:106091:59"/>of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> a Picture of the Arch-Angel S.
<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> drawn by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> as report goes.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Lucaſole,</hi> Chancellor of the
<hi>French</hi> Nation in this City, told me that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had carried away this Picture ſome time-ſince, and ſail'd with it five times out of the Haven, but could not proceed on in their Voyage, becauſe they were ſtopt by an inviſible Hand every time that they intended to ſail away, and could never depart till they had carried back the Picture.</p>
                  <p>The report of this Wonder being ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the City; the <hi>Beduins,</hi> or <hi>Boemiens</hi> as we call them, took a reſolution ſecretly to ſteal it away and ſell it to the <hi>Francs:</hi> Accordingly, when they had broken open the Doors of the Church and pulled it down from the place where it ſtood, they could not poſſibly get out with it; ſo that they were alſo forc'd to put it up again in its place as the
<hi>Venetians</hi> had done before, where it remains ſtill, I have ſeen it.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Lucaſole</hi> told me that this is very true, and that he himſelf was then at <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have read ſomething concerning the Waters of the Ciſterns of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the Book of Monſieur <hi>de la Ch.</hi> that treats of the overflowing of the River <hi>Nilus:</hi> That they become ſalt about the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> and that in the Night that the fruitful Dew falls they return to their former ſweetneſs, and increaſe beſides with the Waters of the River.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not offer to deny flatly a thing that may be true, and which Monſieur <hi>Burattini,</hi> cited by Monſieur <hi>de la Ch.</hi> ſaith hath been obſerv'd by ſeveral Perſons: But I dare ſay that in two ſeveral Voyages into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and during my long abode
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106091:59"/>at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in ſeveral ſeaſons of the Year; though I have obſerv'd, as exactly as I could, all things, I never heard that the Waters of theſe Ciſterns did become ſalt, or that they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe with the Waters of the River, or that they did recover their former freſhneſs and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I have nevertheleſs wondred a little to taſte them ſomewhat ſalt, ſo that they ſeem not to come from ſo freſh a River.</p>
                  <p>This quality proceeds from the nitrous Earth, which may be known by this Experiment; if a piece of Earth about <hi>Alexandria</hi> be put in the hot Sun, it will become white as Snow on that ſide that is towards the Sun.</p>

                  <head>Of the Pillar of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and of the Caves that are near <hi>Alexandria,</hi> not far from it.</head>
                  <p>THE 21ſt of <hi>June</hi> I went to ſee the Pillar of
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and other Rarities thereabouts, in the company of Monſieur
<hi>Truillard,</hi> the Elder, a <hi>French</hi> Merchant, and of the
<hi>Janiſſary</hi> that belongs to the Vice-Conſul. We went out at the Gate called <hi>Babiſſidr,</hi> where this Pillar ſtands upon a little Hill towards the <hi>South.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I drew near, I took notice that it lean'd on one ſide; whereas eight years before it ſtood very ſtreight, when I ſaw it. The cauſe of this are the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who out of a perſwaſion of ſome great Treaſure hid under, have digg'd and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd it, and have drawn out of its Foundation ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great heaps of Stones that held it up; this cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to lean a little on that ſide. They had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown it, had they not found at the bottom <pb n="102" facs="tcp:106091:60"/>Stones of a fearful bigneſs, and ſo great that neither they nor any body elſe was able to draw them out.</p>
                  <p>The Deſcription and Dimenſions of this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar are found in the Book of Monſieur <hi>Thevenot:</hi> Therefore I ſay no more of it here, becauſe I will not ſtuff this Book with ordinary things, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before in other Travels.</p>
                  <p>After we had well viewed this Pillar, we march'd along the
<hi>Calitz,</hi> as far as the place that is over againſt the City Walls, to obſerve the Paſſage of the Waters. We went with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign on the other ſide of the <hi>Calitz,</hi> over the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bridge that is near it: When we came to the little Arches that are under the Walls, through which the River enters into the City, we made our obſervations, and took next the way that leads to the Caves that are in the Fields at <hi>Weſt-South-Weſt</hi> of the Gate out of which we came; and about a quarter of a League, in our way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lake <hi>Sebaca,</hi> we came to the Caves; having left at
<hi>Weſt-North-Weſt</hi> a <hi>Moſque,</hi> in a plain Field, where was buried a certain <hi>Schech</hi> of the <hi>Moors,</hi> called <hi>Sidi gams il gábbari.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At our entrance we went down a dozen ſteps into a very large Alley, digg'd in the Rock, but open a-top; it may be the Vault is fallen by length of time. In this Alley are fifteen great holes cut in the Rock, in the faſhion of great Gates; ſeven are on the right hand, and eight on the left; through which Men enter into the Caves.</p>
                  <p>We went into four with our Torches lighted, our
<hi>Janiſſary</hi> before us; we found round about the Walls, in the firm Rock, from the top to the <pb n="113" facs="tcp:106091:60"/>bottom, holes cut in the Rock very orderly; and of a length and breadth fit to hold a Coffin: Many of theſe Caves were cut, to open a way to others. This inconveniency we found there, they were almoſt all fill'd up with Earth and Sand, which cauſed us to kneel for the moſt part: this did not hinder us from taking notice of that which was moſt remarkable. Whiles we were in one, at the end of the Alley, one of our Company per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, with the light of his Tapers, that one of the holes open'd a paſſage to another Cave; which cauſed us to ſee whether there was not there any thing worthy of our notice: Though the hole was but ſmall and narrow, we crept in upon our Bellies with our lighted Tapers; and one after another we came to the other ſide, where we ſound one of the ſtrangeſt and moſt curious Caves that we had ever ſeen: It was greater, more compleat, and cleaner than any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; built long and ſquare, and well Plaiſter'd with Lime; at each ſide of the Wall, which is the main Rock, there are three ranks of holes, like to thoſe that we had ſeen in the former: In the longer ſides were fifteen in every rank, plac'd one a top of the other; in all they were forty-five. The two ends, or ſides, that were ſhorteſt, had likewiſe three ranks, and three holes at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very rank, nine in all. They were all empty and clean, and no ill ſcent in all the Cave; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in one hole, where we ſaw the Skeleton of the Body of a Man dried up.</p>
                  <p>I conceive that the Learned may deſire my judgment concerning theſe Caves and Holes, and to what purpoſe they were made. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is not eaſie to give a juſt account of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106091:61"/>them; becauſe <hi>Macrizi,</hi> who hath ſpoken of all the remarkable things of <hi>Egypt,</hi> makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Caves: Nevertheleſs it is eaſie to be ſeen, that they could be for no other uſe, but to bury and place the dead. This may be gathered from the faſhion of the holes, which are juſt as long as high, and as large as needs muſt to place a Bier or Coffin; beſides, all the other Caves in <hi>Egypt</hi> were only for that purpoſe: it is therefore very probable that this was for no other purpoſe, let the Reader think what he pleaſeth of them.</p>
                  <p>I do not deny but that they may have ſerv'd the Chriſtians to meet together, and pray God in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, for fear of the Heathens that perſecuted them. I find this Opinion in <hi>Seid ibn Patrik,</hi> a Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his Hiſtory, <hi>p.</hi> 399.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Alexandria</hi> name theſe Caves the
<hi>Súk,</hi> or the Market-place; but there is no likelihood that they have been employed for that uſe.</p>
                  <p>The Rock in which they are cut, is much eaten and conſum'd by time; the holes are likewiſe much decayed, chiefly thoſe that are neareſt to the Door, and in the open air: They receive ſome light from above, through little ſquare holes that are made on purpoſe in the Vaults.</p>
                  <p>The 22th I went round the City, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Walls and Towers. I went into ſix of the chief: The firſt is that which is neareſt to the <hi>French Fondego,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Houſe, before you come to
<hi>Bab il achdar,</hi> or <hi>the green Gate.</hi> It is round, and ſupported within with three ranks of Pillars of red Stone, ſeven in every one.</p>
                  <p>Next to this Tower, we went to the Gate of the old Haven, which at preſent is walled in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="115" facs="tcp:106091:61"/>this Haven is not frequented: both are at the <hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of the City. From this Gate we went to the <hi>Moſque</hi> of the ſeventy, called <hi>Giama il garbis.</hi> We went next by the old Caſtle of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> named
<hi>Borg Muſtapha Pacha,</hi> which ſerv'd heretofore to guard the old Haven; at preſent there are three hundred <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> in Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
                  <p>Till then we walk'd always towards the <hi>Weſt;</hi> but when we had left this Caſtle, we turn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and found next a great Tower; where we got upon the Platform, not by any ſteps, but by a large way made ſloping up.</p>
                  <p>Next to this Tower, we came to <hi>Bab iſſidr,</hi> out of which ſtands the Pillar of <hi>Pompey:</hi> From thence we went to another, called <hi>Bab irraſcîd,</hi> or <hi>the Gate of Roſetta,</hi> along the Walls of the City. I went out of the City, alone with the
<hi>Janiſſary,</hi> to ſee where the River <hi>Nilus</hi> goes into the Channel which anſwers to the Ciſterns of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which I ſhall deſcribe hereafter.</p>
                  <p>When I had fully viewed that which I deſired, I returned into the Town to my company, that waited for me in the ſhade; and all together we walk'd to the Tower of the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſo called, becauſe of late there lodges ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims. We went into it, and found its make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry admirable.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <p>We went next to the Tower of the old Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-houſe, or
<hi>Douane;</hi> ſo nam'd, becauſe when the Sea came to the Walls: of the City on that ſide, the Store-houſes of the Cuſtoms were there: But ſince the Sea is gone from thence, the Gate is ſhut, and the Cuſtom-houſe is establiſh'd and ſettled in another place.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:106091:62"/>
                  <p>This Tower is very big, ſupported within with four ranks of Pillars of red Stone. Here are many Rooms fit for ſtores, for lodgings, and to put Salt in, though much of it is now ruinated. This was the laſt Tower that we ſaw in our Walk, which continued four hours, reckoning the time that we ſpent in viewing the Walls, and climbing up to the Towers.</p>
                  <p>I return at preſent to the Channel, by which the Ciſterns are furniſh'd with Water.</p>
                  <p>It is out of the Gate of <hi>Roſetta,</hi> about ſix Foot high, vaulted in the inſide, about a quarter of a Mile from the City: It joins to the <hi>Calitz</hi> of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> that furniſhes it with Water from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nilus;</hi> from thence the Water runs to the Walls, where it meets with another Conduit not fat from this Gate; which Conduit, or Channel, is made ſo ingeniouſly, that it furniſhes all the Ciſterns of the City with Water.</p>
                  <p>We muſt alſo take notice, that though the Mouth of this Channel is as high as the reſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the two thirds are wall'd from the top to the bottom; ſo that there remains but a ſmall hole where the Waters of the <hi>Calitz</hi> flow in, as through a Window. And becauſe they are very ſalt the firſt three days, and they would fill the Ciſterns with ſlime and filth, if the Water did enter in at that time freely: To prevent this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency, they that have the care of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtop this hole, and leave it ſo three days; which being ended, they go to the entry of the Channel, followed by a crowd of People, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtop the hole, and let in the Water to fill the Ciſterns. This day is a day of great rejoicing all over the City.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:106091:62"/>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Alexandria</hi> hath ſix Gates; three are open, namely that towards the <hi>South,</hi> called <hi>Bab iſſidr;</hi> that which is at the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> named <hi>Bab irraſcîd,</hi> or
<hi>the Gate of Roſetta;</hi> that which looks to the <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> and is named the Sea-Gate. The three Gates that are ſhut are, that of the old Cuſtom-houſe; the green Gate, called by the <hi>Arabs, Bab il achdar;</hi> and that of the old Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>I cannot poſitively affirm whether the Walls and the Gates that are now there, be thoſe that <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> caus'd to be builded, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Califfs</hi> have made them. I imagin that the
<hi>Califfs</hi> have erected them, and not <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> (though many Travellers are of a contrary opinion.) Becauſe there is no <hi>Greek</hi> Inſcriptions to be ſeen, but all <hi>Arab..</hi> Some are written in ſtrange Characters, others in the ordinary <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Character. Theſe Inſcriptions ſpeak of the <hi>Califf,</hi> and Year when they were builded, or re-edified. The Gates being high where theſe Inſcriptions were graven, and the Letters arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially put with other works, I could not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh nor read them. 2. The manner of their building proves this truth; for they are builded as the Gates of <hi>Cairo,</hi> which were the work of the <hi>Califfs,</hi> who have been there many Ages after <hi>Alexander the Great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two Havens in <hi>Alexandria;</hi> the one called the old Haven, where Ships enter in with the <hi>Weſterly</hi> Wind; but now it is of no uſe, but to ſecure the Veſſels that ſail from the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> when the bad Weather obliges them to ſeek for ſhelter. The other is called the new Haven; there all the Ships arrive, <pb n="118" facs="tcp:106091:63"/>and where they now caſt Anchor.</p>
                  <p>The Trade of the <hi>French</hi> Merchants in this City, is the greateſt that they have in all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts; for there is no place in <hi>Turkie</hi> where ſo many <hi>French</hi> Ships come as into this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; from the beginning of the Year 1672, to the Month of
<hi>June,</hi> there was no leſs than nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>French</hi> Ships that came hither; and in the Month of <hi>June</hi> I reckoned fourteen.</p>
                  <p>This is a conſiderable number, but not to be compar'd with the number of Veſſels that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented this Haven heretofore: For Monſieur
<hi>Lucaſole,</hi> that did the Office of Chancellor of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, told me that he remembers that there have been at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in one Year, ninety-four <hi>French</hi> Ships.</p>

                  <p>The 23d of this Month, I ſaw a <hi>Moor</hi> return from a Race that he had made, to ſhew his ſtrength, and to be admitted amongſt the Poſts that carry Letters from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that will be admitted to be Poſt, or Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or Carrier of Letters, muſt carry upon his Shoulders a Fire lighted in an Iron Basket, made as a great Chafing-diſh, faſten'd at the end of a great Staff about the length of a Man, to which are tied ſeveral Hoops of Iron, all weighing 36 <hi>Rotols.</hi> With this burden he muſt go twenty-ſeven Miles in the way to <hi>Roſetta,</hi> and return the ſame day to the City before the ſetting of the Sun, in all about 54 Miles; he is to go always loaden with the ſame burden. If he performs this, he is not only admitted amongſt the Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Letters, but he wins the Wager that others have made againſt him; but if his ſtrength fails him, he loſeth his Wager, and his Employment that he pretends to.</p>
                  <p>The Man that I ſaw returning the ſame day to the City, and finiſhing his courſe with honour, becauſe he was return'd when the Sun was two <pb n="129" facs="tcp:106091:68"/>hours high, won a Wager of fifteen
<hi>Piaſters,</hi> and was admitted amongſt the Poſts, or Carriers of Letters; and gathered beſides, about eight <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> or thereabouts, from the beholders of his glorious return; but he was in ſuch a ſweat that one would have judg'd him to be coming out of ſome Bath. He was followed by a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of People both Horſe and Foot, ſome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Wood to entertain his Fire, others Water to refreſh and cool him; that before I knew the cauſe of this Meeting, I thought there had been ſome Tumult in the City.</p>
                  <p>When I had continued ſo long time in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> as was needful for my affairs, and having loſt my <hi>Quartane Fever</hi> that had plagued me ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Months, I departed very well ſatisfied, for
<hi>Roſetta,</hi> on the Feſtival day of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S.
<hi>Paul.</hi> I went this time by Sea, becauſe I had been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Land: I went aboard a Ship, and in five hours we came to <hi>Roſetta,</hi> but not without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Ship-wrack at the Mouth of <hi>Nilus;</hi> for the Waters of the River meet ſo furiouſly with the Waves of the Sea, that they are able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright the moſt skilful Pilots of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                  <p>ON the 30th of <hi>June</hi> I went from <hi>Roſetta,</hi> with an intention to viſit the four Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Deſarts of S.
<hi>Macarius:</hi> for that purpoſe I went aboard of a Boat of a
<hi>Janiſſary,</hi>

<hi>Reus Ahmed il Curdi,</hi> a Man very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the
<hi>Francs,</hi> to go with him to <pb n="130" facs="tcp:106091:69"/>
                     <hi>Tarane,</hi> or
<hi>Terenut,</hi> as the <hi>Copties</hi> call it in their Dictionary. It is a little Village in the <hi>Caſcieflik</hi> of <hi>Beheire,</hi> four and twenty hours travelling from <hi>Cairo,</hi> ſcituate upon the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> the place where Men commonly go a-ſhore when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to travel to thoſe Monaſteries. But, before I came to that Village, I received many affronts from ſome young <hi>Turks,</hi> becauſe I carried with me a little Box full of Wine. A zealous <hi>Cadi</hi> being troubled in Conſcience for being in the company of a <hi>Franc</hi> that drunk Wine, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd them to ask me ſome, that he might have an occaſion to quarrel with me, if I did give them ſome. Theſe Rogues having the Authority of a <hi>Cadi</hi> to countenance their wicked deſign, four of the boldeſt ask'd me ſome very earneſtly; for they ſaid they knew that I had ſome. I excus'd my ſelf at firſt, that I could not give them any to drink, becauſe they were not to drink Wine; and that I knew very well that it was a great Crime for a <hi>Franc</hi> to give Wine to a <hi>Muſulman,</hi> chiefly in a place where many others would be offended at it, and that ſuch an action might bring me into trouble. But all theſe reaſons could not prevail; they would have ſome <hi>Volens Nolens,</hi> threatning that if I denied them they would caſt my Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River. When I ſaw my ſelf in this danger, I intreated the <hi>Reus,</hi> unto whom I was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Vice-Conſul of <hi>Roſetta,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me. He did ſo much by his credit, that he pacified them for that time.</p>
                  <p>At my arrival at <hi>Tarane,</hi> whither I was to go a-ſhore, I hired in the Morning a little Boat to carry me, and my Cloaths and Proviſions, to the Village; for our Veſſel was great and well loaden,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106091:69"/>and could not at that time go near the ſhore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Water was not deep. Three of theſe <hi>Turks</hi> caſt themſelves furiouſly into my Boat, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my Box in earneſt to caſt it into the River. I ſnatch'd it from them, and run to my Muſquet as if I intended to ſhoot at them: my <hi>Black-a-moor</hi> likewiſe, who was couragious, took one by the Neck and caſt him into the River, and with his Sword in his Hand put himſelf in a poſture of defence; When they ſaw that they had to do with Men of courage that were not afraid of them, they went back into the Barque, and very furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſaulted the <hi>Reus</hi> with their Fiſts; beſides, they accus'd him, as he himſelf told me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, at his return to <hi>Cairo,</hi> before his <hi>Aga,</hi> to have drank Wine with a <hi>Franc,</hi> making him pay, as a puniſhment, ten
<hi>Piaſters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Rencounter, I had another Accident that happen'd to me, far more grievous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. At my landing I wanted a Man to carry my Cloaths to the Houſe where I intended to lodge; I called therefore ſome of the <hi>Arabians</hi> that were newly arriv'd from the Deſarts of S.
<hi>Macarius</hi> with <hi>Nitre,</hi> or <hi>Salt-Peter:</hi> He that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried my Box of Wine finding it to be very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and knowing not what was in it, he thought it had been a Box of Money; therefore being proud of his burden, he told all that he met with in the way, that he carry'd a Box full of Money, that belong'd to a <hi>Franc</hi> newly arriv'd, that was going to the Monaſteries. This lye ſpread about the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and was believ'd as true, ſo that I was in no ſmall danger; for there was no other talk in the Town but of the rich <hi>Franc</hi> that was there, and of the means to get his Money: They thought I had <pb n="132" facs="tcp:106091:70"/>been ſome Conſul that travell'd <hi>incognito</hi> to ſee the Country, therefore they reſolv'd to wait for me in the way, and to take from me all my Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>In this manner I landed at <hi>Tarane,</hi> on a
<hi>Sunday,</hi> and went to lodge at a poor Carpenters Houſe, a Chriſtian
<hi>Coptie,</hi> the only Chriſtian in that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; he allowed me for my Chamber, a place where he put Straw for his Beaſts; it was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Faggots of Palm-trees, heap'd one upon another, to hinder the heats of the Sun: I found there two religious Perſons of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries whither I intended to go, with them I paſt my fears and apprehenſions.</p>
                  <p>When I underſtood, from all hands, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy that the
<hi>Arabians</hi> had form'd againſt me; the danger oblig'd me the the next day, to deſire the <hi>Caſcief</hi> of that place to give me a Guard, to bring me ſafe to the Monaſteries; and that I might perſwade him the ſooner, I gave him ſome Pounds of Coffee and Loaves of Sugar, which I had brought with me for that purpoſe; for it is the Cuſtom in <hi>Turkie,</hi> when a favour is deſired from a <hi>Turk,</hi> to begin with Gifts: But the
<hi>Caſcief</hi> having heard what report went of me, anſwer'd me, that a ſmall Guard would do me but little good, becauſe the <hi>Arabians</hi> had formed a deſign to wait for me in the way, and to cut my Throat, and that it was needful that he ſhould Guard me himſelf; which he promis'd to do within a few days, after that he had finiſh'd ſome buſineſs of importance.</p>
                  <p>I was mightily troubled when I heard what the <hi>Caſcief</hi> offer'd me. It was to no purpoſe when I told him that I was no Conſul, as the report went of me without any colour of truth, but rather a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106091:70"/>poor <hi>Franc</hi> that went to the Monaſteries to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect my ſelf in the Language of the Country; That in this Box there was no Money, but only ſome Glaſs Bottles of Wine which I carried with me, becauſe I was never us'd to drink Water. All this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was to no purpoſe, he was ſo prepoſſeſs'd with the falſe report that I could not be believ'd. When I ſaw that I ſpent my labour in vain, I went to my Lodging without accepting his offer.</p>
                  <p>At that time I had news that <hi>Naſſr Allá,</hi> an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of one of the Monaſteries, that I intended to viſit, was at a Village at the other ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, call'd <hi>Tuh ineſſára,</hi> not far from <hi>Tarane</hi> down the Current, about ſome concerns of his Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. I ſent him a Letter, written in
<hi>Arabic,</hi> by one of the Lay Monks whom I found at my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at
<hi>Tarane,</hi> acquainting him with my intention, and all that had happen'd between me and the <hi>Caſcief,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> intreating him to tell me how I ſhould get free from thoſe People; I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd him that I ſhould be for ever oblig'd to him, and that all the favour he ſhould ſhew me would be pleaſing to his Partriarch, who was my very good Friend, and had recommended me to the Governours of thoſe Monaſteries. But this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil Abbot was ſo far from anſwering to my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I expected, that he kept with him the Meſſenger, and would not ſuffer him to return back.</p>
                  <p>When I ſaw the Abbots incivility, and being more deſirous to proceed on in my Journy, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe difficulties; I reſolved once more to viſit the <hi>Caſcief,</hi> to intreat him to give me a Guard, thinking to find him of another judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he was before when I ſaw him firſt, but <pb n="134" facs="tcp:106091:71"/>I receiv'd from him the ſame anſwer; He told me that he would not have me venture, unleſs he Guarded me himſelf; that he muſt anſwer to the <hi>Pacha</hi> for my Life, if any miſchance did happen to me in my Journy, and that he knew that I was but ill accommodated with the Chriſtian; he deſired me therefore to take a Chamber at his Houſe. I muſt confeſs that this ſecond offer, as well as the firſt, did ſtrangely trouble me: for this earneſt deſire that he did diſcover of Guarding me in his own Perſon, was no good Omen to me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, his Reputation was but bad in the Village; and when I ſhould have had no reaſon to fear him, and that his intentions had been very good, the expences I muſt have been at for him and his Company, and the Gifts that I muſt have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him for his pains, would have ruined me; for I knew that a <hi>Caſcief</hi> never ventures out in a Journy without a great train of Horſe and Foot, and without expecting great matters.</p>
                  <p>When I ſaw the danger and trouble that I had in this Journy, I reſolved to return to <hi>Cairo</hi> as ſoon as I could. With this reſolution I ſpent the reſt of the day in my Lodging, thinking how I might be able to compaſs it. About two hours in the Night I heard knocking at the Door very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and becauſe it was no ſeaſonable time to ſpeak with me, and that the Perſon knockt very hard, I began to think that I was in danger: That I might not be ſurpriz'd, I awak'd the Perſons in the Houſe, and took my Weapons in my hand, ſending my <hi>Black-a-moor</hi> to ſee who was there; he return'd to me, and told me that it was a Groom of the
<hi>Caſcief</hi> that was deſirous to ſpeak with me, concerning a buſineſs of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. <pb n="135" facs="tcp:106091:71"/>I caus'd him to come in, and found that it was he that had introduc'd me to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters preſence, unto whom I had made ſome ſmall Gifts: As ſoon as he ſaw me, he intreated me by his Religion and mine, as the Cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is, to go away immediately, as ſecretly as I could; for his Maſter intended to kill me, becauſe he thought I was a Man that travell'd up and down only to ſeek for the Treaſures of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Egyptians:</hi> And that he might more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently perform this bloody deſign, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to lead me himſelf towards the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the middle of the Wilderneſs, where he would ſuffer me to reſt, and afterwards cut my Throat: And if afterwards any ſhould inquire for a <hi>Franc</hi> that was gone by
<hi>Tarane</hi> to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, he would ſay that he is gone to
<hi>Cairo</hi> by another way: He told me alſo, that about a Month before that, his Maſter had kill'd a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> Traveller of
<hi>Barbary,</hi> and had caſt his Body into the River, for the ſame cauſe.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I underſtood this bad news, I had no more mind to ſleep, I gave him the reward that he had deſerv'd, and ſent to ſeek a Camel to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my Cloaths; and about one of the Clock in the Night I departed to go to the paſſage that leads to <hi>Gizéy,</hi> a Village ſcituated on the other ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> about an hour and a halfs travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from <hi>Tarane</hi> down the Water: I agreed there with a Maſter of a Boat to carry me and my Cloaths over; and about break of the Day I went aboard very ſpeedily: As ſoon as we were lanch'd into the River, from Land, I ſaw the <hi>Caſcief</hi> galloping towards us with about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men on Horſe back to catch me; but he <pb n="136" facs="tcp:106091:72"/>miſs'd of his intent, for I was out of his reach.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Gizéy,</hi> as I was waiting for an opportunity to return to <hi>Cairo,</hi> the Abbot <hi>Naſſr alla,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before, came thither and offer'd to conduct me to the Monaſteries, if I would return to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane</hi> in his company; but I had no mind any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to viſit them.</p>
                  <p>I went from <hi>Gizéy</hi> the ſame day, being
<hi>Fryday,</hi> towards <hi>Cairo;</hi> and the next Night we lodg'd at
<hi>Verdan,</hi> a Village ſcituate on the <hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of
<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> not far from <hi>Boulak;</hi> and on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 9th of <hi>July,</hi> I enter'd into <hi>Cairo,</hi> from whence I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the
7th of <hi>June.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt I was at <hi>Tarane,</hi> the <hi>Caſcief</hi>'s Clark, who was a <hi>Coptie</hi> and a Chriſtian, came to ſee me ſometimes. I underſtood from him what the Lakes of <hi>Salt-Peter,</hi> or
<hi>Niter,</hi> yield to the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi> every Year. He told me, that this Year within the ſpace of nine Months, they had drawn four and twenty thouſand <hi>Quintals,</hi> and that they muſt take up twelve thouſand more to make up the ordinary Sum that is drawn: So that every
<hi>Quintal</hi> being ſold for 25 <hi>Meidins,</hi> this Revenue comes to 36 Purſes, or 18000 Crowns, <hi>French</hi> Money, by the Year.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as it is taken out of the Lakes they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it upon Camels to <hi>Tarane,</hi> where it is weighed, and from thence ſent to
<hi>Cairo,</hi> or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to be ſold.</p>
                  <p>For this cauſe a <hi>Caſcief</hi> dwells here, who though he be but little in Authority, and ſubject to the <hi>Caſcief</hi> of
<hi>Beheire,</hi> he is forc'd to buy this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and pay for it four and twenty Purſes; one half to the <hi>Caſcief</hi> of <hi>Beheire,</hi> and the other half to the <hi>Pacha:</hi> he keeps alſo twenty <hi>Spahins</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:106091:72"/>to wait upon him, and guard his Country; he is the Lord of theſe Monaſteries.</p>
                  <p>But before I proceed on in my Journal, I will give a ſhort account of ſome remarkable things in this Deſart, as I have heard them from one that hath been an Abbot in one of the Monaſteries.</p>
                  <p>Firſt there is to be ſeen, between the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of S.
<hi>Macarius,</hi> and of <hi>Amba Biſcioi,</hi> and a little further in the Wilderneſs, a long rank of little heaps of Earth, a Foot from one another, plac'd as in a way; which, as the Monks ſay, was put there by the Angels, that the Hermites might be able to find the way to the Church when they were deſirous to hear Divine Service on <hi>Sundays;</hi> for before they were apt to go out of the way: Therefore this way is called now, <hi>Tarik il meláike,</hi> or, <hi>The way of Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly I have underſtood from an old Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript in
<hi>Arab.</hi> that in the Wilderneſs were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſeven great Monaſteries; namely, 1. of S. <hi>Macarius;</hi> 2. Of S. <hi>John the little,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Igumène;</hi> 3. Of <hi>Amba Biſcíoi;</hi> 4. Of S. <hi>Maſſine,</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;</hi> 5. That of <hi>Amba Moſes,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Black;</hi> 6. That of <hi>Amba Kéma;</hi> 7. That of the holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of <hi>Syria:</hi> and that beſides theſe ſeven Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, there were three hundred dwellings of Hermites, and ſolitary People that ſerved God in this Wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>But now, of all theſe Monaſteries, there are but two remarkable; namely, the Monaſtery of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and that of
<hi>Amba Biſcioi.</hi> They are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with very good Water. The firſt hath two Churches; one for the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and another for the
<hi>Copties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that of the <hi>Syrians</hi> is to be ſeen a miraculous
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106091:73"/>Tree, growing from the Staff of S. <hi>Ephrem.</hi> This holy Man left it at the Gate when he went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit one in the Monaſtery, and immediately it ſhot forth Roots downwards, and Leaves upwards, with Flowers. They ſay, that there is no ſuch Tree to be found in all
<hi>Egypt</hi> beſides.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the Monaſtery of S. <hi>John the little,</hi> which now is much decayed, is to be ſeen a Tree that grew likewiſe from this Saints Staff miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, when he had fix'd it into the Ground at his Superiors command, and water'd it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they call it, becauſe of this Act of Obedience, <hi>Scieigiaret ittáa,</hi> or <hi>the Tree of Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the way that leads from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of the
<hi>Syrians</hi> to the Mountain of the Eagles Stones, is to be ſeen the Bed of <hi>Bahr Belá me,</hi> or River without Water; which was dried up, as the Monks relate, at the Prayers of the ancient Hermites that dwelt about its Banks; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were grievouſly troubled by the Pyrats that ſailed upon it, therefore they obtain'd from God this favour.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in this Deſart is to be ſeen another Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, call'd by the <hi>Arabians, Lahm iggiúf;</hi> but becauſe I could not well underſtand what it was, I could deſire that ſome other Traveller would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it out, that we may better know what to think of it.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>A Walk to the Garden of <hi>Ma-Tárea.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE 12th of <hi>July</hi> I went, in the Company of ſome
<hi>French</hi> Merchants, to the Village of <hi>Ma-Tárea,</hi> ſcituate on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> about <pb n="139" facs="tcp:106091:73"/>two hours riding on Horſe-back, to viſit the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which Chriſt and his moſt holy Mother have ſanctified with their abode, and the Garden where the Balm Plants were ſet formerly.</p>
                  <p>At the entry into the Court which is before this Garden there is to be ſeen, at the right hand, a ſmall Oratory of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which one <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> who was <hi>Pacha</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> about thirteen years ago, caus'd to be built out of a hatred of the <hi>Copties,</hi> upon the ruins of a Church which belong'd to them, and where they reverenc'd ſome Relicks and ſteps of our Lord, and of his moſt holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Pacha</hi> chang'd, as we have ſaid, this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel into an Oratory of <hi>Turks,</hi> that no Chriſtian might have the liberty to enter in and viſit it. But ſince the <hi>Turks</hi> have forſaken it one may go in freely without hindrance; therefore it is no longer named an Oratory, but <hi>il Mákad,</hi> or <hi>the place of reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Mákad</hi> is a little Ciſtern of Marble of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours, full of Water, which comes into it by a Channel from the miraculous Well that is near by. The <hi>Copties</hi> ſay, from Tradition, that the bleſſed Virgin was wont to waſh in it the Linen of her divine Son; and that whilſt ſhe was employed in working, ſhe laid him in a little hole which is in the Wall of the <hi>Mákad,</hi> a place where ſome reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Francs</hi> have heretofore ſaid Maſs, out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                  <p>However it be, I will not deny a Tradition ſo ancient; but it is ſo hard to reconcile all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which they bring to prove it, that when I had done all that I could to underſtand the truth, I ſound ſuch doubts as did rather <pb n="140" facs="tcp:106091:74"/>contradict, than eſtabliſh any ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>Very near this <hi>Mákad,</hi> or reſting place, is the miraculous Well, very deep. Its Waters are lighter and ſweeter than the Waters of <hi>Nilus.</hi> This is ſo well known, that the <hi>Pacha</hi>'s drink of it, and prefer it to the Waters of the River.</p>
                  <p>The Tradition of the <hi>Copties</hi> ſay, and ſome
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Hiſtorians agree to it, as <hi>Amru ibn il verdi,</hi> that our Saviour hath waſh'd himſelf in this Well, and by a Miracle he hath given this ſweetneſs, and extraordinary pleaſantneſs to theſe Waters.</p>
                  <p>Its Sourſe, or Spring, is not well known. Some think that it came by a Miracle, others ſay that it proceeds from <hi>Nilus</hi> under ground. But I think it impoſſible; 1. Becauſe of the great diſtance between the River and this Well; 2. Becauſe when the Waters of <hi>Nilus</hi> are corrupt and thick, the Water of this Well is clear, whereas if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of the River, it would be as thick as the Waters of
<hi>Nilus;</hi> 3. becauſe the Water of this Well never riſeth, nor falls, as the River doth, but is always equal in height; finally I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, from the name given to it, <hi>Má-Tarea,</hi> which ſignifies freſh Water; this ſignifies that it hath a particular Sourſe, and a quality not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Waters of <hi>Nilus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mahometans</hi> ſay, that it proceeds from the Well
<hi>Bir iſſimſim,</hi> which is at <hi>Mecha;</hi> a famous Well, becauſe of a pretended Miracle of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi> But this is a Fable invented by ſome of their <hi>Sciechs,</hi> to obtain more credit to their Prophet; for <hi>Mecha</hi> is diſtant from <hi>Cairo</hi> one and thirty days journy, as the <hi>Caravan</hi> makes them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is impoſſible that a Well ſhould be in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> 
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:106091:74"/>proceeding from a Sourſe at ſuch a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>After that we had eaten in the reſting place, and drank of this good Water out of devotion, we went into the Garden, where heretofore the Balm trees were Planted, which yielded Balm on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they ſtood in this place, and were watered with the Water of the miraculous Well. One may read my Book upon this Subject, called <hi>The Church of Alexandria;</hi> where many remarkable things may be found, very curious, concerning theſe Trees and this Well.</p>
                  <p>In this Garden was heretofore to be ſeen the Sicamore-tree, which, as the <hi>Copties</hi> ſay, ſplit in two miraculouſly, to hide our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his moſt holy Mother, when the Souldiers of
<hi>Herod</hi> purſued him: They ſay, that when they hid themſelves in this opening of the Sicamore, they ſaved themſelves from the Souldiers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, by the favour of a Spiders Web that cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſuddenly, and appeared very old, though it was made in an inſtant by a Miracle: ſo that that they imagin'd not that any Perſon could be hid within, much leſs the Perſons whom they were ſeeking.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Franciſcans</hi> of the Holy Land, that dwell at
<hi>Cairo,</hi> diſpute with the Keepers of this Garden, the poſſeſſion of this Tree; and ſay, that it fell down with old age in the year 1656. and that they gather'd then up the pieces which they keep carefully in their place of Relicks; I have ſeen them there. The Gardiners yet ſhew in this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a Stump which I have ſeen, which they ſay are the remains of this Sicamore. But this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute concerns me not much, neither do I think that I ſhould oblige thoſe Fathers to maintain
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106091:75"/>their intereſt in this caſe that is ſo trivial.</p>
                  <p>When we had ſeen this Sicamore, we went out of the Garden to ſee the Needle, which is out of the Village, planted in the open Field, where ſtood anciently the City <hi>Heliopolis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Needle is not equally ſquare, for there are two ſides larger than the others: The largeſt are each of ſix Foot, and the narroweſt of five and a half. There be but few Characters graven upon it, but they be yet to be read; and thoſe that are graven in one ſide, are alſo in the three others. It is of a red Stone, as all other Needles that I have ſeen in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Planted upon the ground without any Baſis to ſtand upon.</p>
                  <p>Near this Needle is a ſquare Stone of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary bigneſs, which ſeems to have been the Baſis of ſome great Pillar; but it is worn on the ſides, therefore I neglected to take the meaſure of it.</p>
                  <p>In this Field <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> encamp'd with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when he engaged in a Fight with <hi>Sultan Cajed Bey,</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Mammelucs;</hi> ſome of the Trenches of his Camp are yet to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>I went next alone from <hi>Má-Tarea</hi> to
<hi>Mínied Sored,</hi> another Village hard by on the
<hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide, to ſee a miraculous Image of the bleſſed Virgin, which the <hi>Copties</hi> keep in their Church; of which I have read a Miracle in an <hi>Abyſſin</hi> Manuſcript, which I found in the Monaſtery of
<hi>Koskam,</hi> near <hi>Momfallot</hi> in the middle <hi>Egypt,</hi> at my firſt Voyage into <hi>Egypt.</hi> As ſoon as I had ſeen it, I return'd to
<hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 17th of <hi>July, Saturday</hi> Night, I went to the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> ſcituated out of the Old <hi>Cairo</hi> at the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide, about half an hours <pb n="143" facs="tcp:106091:75"/>riding on Horſe-back, in the Field called, in <hi>Arab. Birket ſiech Ombarek,</hi> or the Lake of the bleſſed <hi>Sciech;</hi> where I ſpent the Night to hear Maſs; for the <hi>Copties</hi> ſay it ordinarily after Midnight.</p>
                  <p>The next day I return'd back to my Lodging, and ſaw in my paſſage all the Churches and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the <hi>Copties</hi> which are in Old <hi>Cairo;</hi> leaving on our left hand the three Churches which are in <hi>Babylon Maſſr,</hi> which was heretofore part of Old
<hi>Cairo,</hi> but is now totally deſtroyed. I began my viſit by the Churches that are in <hi>Caſſr Iſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cémma.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Churches, and Monaſteries of <hi>Caſſr Iſſcémma.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE firſt was that of <hi>Maállaca:</hi> It is a very ancient Church, ſtately and very clear; and I may ſay that it is the moſt beautiful that the <hi>Copties</hi> have in <hi>Egypt.</hi> It is the Metropolis in which the Patriarch performs his firſt Divine Service.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> bought it of <hi>Amru ibn il Aſſ,</hi> as may appear by the Contract written upon the Walls of this Church with the Hand of this Prince, who curſeth there all the <hi>Mahometans</hi> that ſhall offer to take it from them.</p>
                  <p>There be five <hi>Heikels,</hi> or Chappels, in a rank; but ſeparated the one from the other with little Grates of Wood: ſo that five Maſſes may be read at once, and the Prieſts need not interrupt one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                  <p>At the entry of this Church a little Image is to be ſeen, at the right hand, upon one of the Pillars: which Image, the <hi>Copties</hi> ſay, ſpoke to S. <hi>Ephrem,</hi> 
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:106091:76"/>one of their Patriarchs, to comfort him in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, when <hi>Meéz le din alla,</hi> the <hi>Califf,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to tranſport Mount <hi>Gebel il mocáttam,</hi> which now ſtands behind the Caſtle of
<hi>Cairo,</hi> from one place to another, to prove the truth of his Religion; becauſe our Saviour Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpel, <hi>If you had faith as a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed, you ſhould ſay to this Mountain, remove thence to yonder place, and it ſhall remove; and nothing ſhall be impoſſible unto you.</hi> He threatned him therefore that if he did not remove it, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all his Nation, as a People that profeſſed a falſe Religion, and that deſerved not to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that were Believers. Becauſe this Image ſpoke then to their Patriarch, to comfort him and aſſure him that he ſhould remove the Mountain in ſpight of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who had anger'd this <hi>Califf</hi> againſt them, they highly reſpect it.</p>
                  <p>Next to <hi>Maállaca,</hi> I went to viſit <hi>Sancta Barba;</hi> where, as my leader told me, the Body of this Saint reſts at the left hand of the Chappel. This Church is great and very light, and therefore ſeems to me to be the moſt pleaſant of all the reſt. There be alſo three Chappels in a rank.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw next the Church of Saint <hi>Sergius,</hi> which was built, as <hi>Said ibn Patrik</hi> ſaith in his Hiſtory, by a
<hi>Coptie,</hi> a Secretary to <hi>Abd ilaziz ibn Meruán,</hi> a
<hi>Califf</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under this Church is to be ſeen a Cave, in which, as the
<hi>Copties</hi> hold by Tradition, Chriſt with his moſt bleſſed Mother have lived a while. It is divided into three Angles, or Parts, by little Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. In the firſt, at the entrance, is the Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Font of the
<hi>Copties:</hi> At the bottom of the middle ſeparation is a place in the Wall, and in <pb n="145" facs="tcp:106091:76"/>this place a Stone, which, as the
<hi>Copties</hi> believe, hath been ſanctified with the ſteps of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour. The religious <hi>Francs</hi> ſometimes ſay Maſs here. In the third ſeparation is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stone ſanctified alſo by our Saviour's foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps.</p>
                  <p>In the Cave, I remember not well in which ſeparation, is to be ſeen the Epitaph of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Europe,</hi> buried there about two hundred and ſeventy five years ago, in <hi>Gothick</hi> Letters; but the Stone is plac'd upſide-down, through the ignorance of the Maſon, as I believe; this is the Epitaph.
<q>Hic jacet Nobilis Petrus Louys IX. Neapollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, qui obiit M.CCCC.II. die. XI. Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arii.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next to this Church, I viſited that of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lady, in the Street called <hi>Darb ittáka.</hi> It is very ſmall, and very obſcure. Out of this Church I ſaw a little round Stone of black Marble, lying upon the ground; about it were graven ſmall Hieroglyphick Letters.</p>
                  <p>At a little diſtance from this Church, through an Alley, is to be ſeen the remains of a <hi>Perſian</hi> Temple, called in <hi>Arab. Kobbet il fors,</hi> or <hi>the Temple of the Perſians,</hi> which
<hi>Artaxerxes Ochus,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> caus'd to be built in honour of the Fire; and though the Ruines are but ſmall, they diſcover yet that this Temple was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very ſtately. In the inſide, about the Walls, are to be ſeen ſeveral ſtandings, or holes, as high as a Man, in which it is probable they plac'd their Idols.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:106091:77"/>
                  <p>I ſaw next the Church of <hi>Mary Girges,</hi> or of S.
<hi>George,</hi> which is in the ſame Street called <hi>Darb ittáka,</hi> or <hi>the Street of the Window.</hi> It is very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and of a mean beauty. At the entrance, on the right hand, is to be ſeen the Body of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Biſſúra,</hi> Biſhop and Martyr, with his Epitaph in <hi>Arabick,</hi> which I could not place here, becauſe the Printer had not the Characters.</p>
                  <p>Next to this Church I went to ſee the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Nuns, amongſt the <hi>Copties,</hi> called <hi>Dér il benát,</hi> or <hi>the Monaſtery of the Maids,</hi> which was built, as they ſay, by a King called <hi>Alexander;</hi> but it is a place ſo filthy and ſtinking, that I could not ſtay there any time.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Church that I ſaw in this Caſtle, was that of the Monaſtery of S. <hi>George,</hi> of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Greeks.</hi> In this Church is to be ſeen an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of this Saint, that, as they ſay, hath the Power to heal and cure Fools. This Monaſtery alſo is very ugly, and filthy.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Churches, and Monaſteries, in the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch's Quarters.</head>
                  <p>IN the Quarters of the Patriarch, named in <hi>Arab. Haret il Bátrak,</hi> a Suburb of it ſelf, on this ſide of <hi>Caſſr Iſſcémma,</hi> is the Church of <hi>Mary Moncure.</hi> It is very great, high, and built with very ſtrong Walls. In this Church the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of the <hi>Copties</hi> is choſen and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>It hath been ruinated by the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and turn'd into a Store-houſe of Sugar-Canes. It continued ſo to the days of the Patriarch <hi>Ephrem,</hi> 
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:106091:77"/>who, in the Reign of <hi>Meez le din alla,</hi> having tranſported the Mountain called <hi>Gebel il mocát<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> which now ſtands behind the Caſtle of
<hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> to prove the truth of his Religion, and that of the
<hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> to be falſe, got an Order from him to the Court of <hi>Beit il mal,</hi> or <hi>Treaſure of the Goods of the deceaſed;</hi> that out of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure this Church ſhould be re-built with all the Apartments that are round about, and all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Churches that are above it: Which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly performed, as may be ſeen in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Patriarch's of <hi>Macrizi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mekkin,</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtorian, confirms this Relation; and aſcribes this Miracle to this Saint, as he ſaith in his Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vádeh ibn Régia,</hi> a Noble Man amongſt the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who turned Chriſtian; a little while after being very thirſty at <hi>Mecha,</hi> he pray'd to this Saint that he might be carryed into this Church, becauſe at that time the River <hi>Nilus</hi> running cloſe by, he might there quench his violent thirſt. This Saint carried him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into this Church in one Night, a way that the
<hi>Caravan</hi> cannot perform in leſs than eight and thirty, or forty days.</p>
                  <p>At the entrance into this Church, on the left hand, is the Cave where dwelt heretofore <hi>Amba Berſum il Erián,</hi> or <hi>Saint Berſum the naked;</hi> which was before the abode of a Serpent that did much hurt to the Inhabitants round about. In the Walls are to be ſeen the holes where he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but as ſoon as the Saint was enter'd in to do Penance, the Serpent caſt it ſelf at his feet, to do him homage, and afterwards it never hurt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body. In this Cave is a little Altar to ſay Maſs.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:106091:78"/>
                  <p>A little above this ſame Church there is four or five ſmall Churches which I had liberty to ſee the night of the Feſtival of the
<hi>Epiphany</hi> of the <hi>Copties,</hi> in the Year 1673. I ſtaid there to ſee the Ceremony they obſerve, in dipping themſelves in the Water, in remembrance of Chriſt's Baptiſm. The Reader may, in the ſequel of this Journal, ſee this deſcribed in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> 1673.</p>
                  <p>Near this Church, is that of <hi>Amba Scinúde,</hi> or of Saint <hi>Sennodius;</hi> but the <hi>Turks</hi> have ſhut it, to draw from the <hi>Copties</hi> a ſum of Money, therefore I could not ſee it.</p>
                  <p>When I was out of the Patriarch's Quarters, I went ſtraight to
<hi>Cairo</hi> to ſee the other Churches and Monaſteries that are thereabout: when I was come as far as the Bridge called <hi>Kantaret iggibs,</hi> or <hi>the Plaiſter'd Bridge,</hi> I turn'd to my right hand, and when I was paſt the heaps of Ruines and Rubbiſh that are there, I came to the Monaſtery of <hi>Mary Mina,</hi> or S. <hi>Menna,</hi> which is an Hoſpital rather, for poor old Men, than a Monaſtery.</p>
                  <p>Within the Walls of this Monaſtery are three Churches; one belongs to the <hi>Copties,</hi> the other to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and the third to the <hi>Syrians;</hi> but it is a filthy place, and the Churches arc but dark.</p>

                  <p>And becauſe <hi>Egypt</hi> is ſuch a Country that one cannot travel in it all the year, and in every ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for ſometimes you are hinder'd by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heats that burn and ſcorch your bodies, ſometimes by the overflowing of <hi>Nilus</hi> that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all the Fields under water, and ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Arabians</hi> are ſcattered about the ways; and when theſe inconveniencies don't hinder, the
<hi>Caſciefs</hi> or Governours ſometimes are wont to fright Travellers, for commonly they be little Tyrants, who live by extortion and oppreſſion of the perſons that have the unhappineſs to fall into their hands: Therefore to accompliſh this Journey with more ſafety, I waited for the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>Fiúm,</hi> for then the ways are full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that carry Grapes to <hi>Cairo,</hi> and then the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> retreat into the Deſarts, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be fear'd.</p>
                  <p>In this ſeaſon I undertook this Journey that I had long deſigned; I went from <hi>Cairo</hi> Monday the 21. of <hi>July.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that I might not fall into the ſame danger as at

<hi>Cairo</hi> the prefixt day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Noon.</p>
                  <p>At our arrival at the Monaſtery of <hi>Aduvie,</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:106091:79"/>which is about an hours travelling from Old
<hi>Cairo,</hi> ſcituate upon the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> we paſt to the other ſide of the River, and from thence we march'd to
<hi>Mocanan,</hi> a very good Town, a place where dwells an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, very famous, called <hi>Ibn Chabir;</hi> at night we got as far as
<hi>Kahue Barnaſcht,</hi> a Coffee-houſe built at the entry in of the Wilderneſs through which one goes to <hi>Fiúm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that we had reſted our ſelves a little, we proceeded on in our journey before the Sun-ſet, marching through the Wilderneſs with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in our Company, who had overtaken as whiles we ſtayed.</p>
                  <p>We ſpent nine hours in going through this Deſart, going all night through a Campane very equal, full of Sand, and houndleſs, and in the morning before the Sun-riſing we arriv'd at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieh,</hi> a very great and conſiderable Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Caſcieflik</hi> of
<hi>Fiúm,</hi> ſcituate at the end of the Wilderneſs, about five hours journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Fiúm</hi> for a Horſeman.</p>
                  <p>When we had reſted here a while, and drunk ſome Coffee, according to the cuſtom of the Country, we march'd on in our way, and enter'd into <hi>Fiúm</hi> about Noon.</p>
                  <p>At my firſt arrival, I lodg'd in a publick Inn called
<hi>Ocalet Beida,</hi> ſcituate near the Market, and almoſt ruinated, till I could meet with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more convenient abode. About ten days after I chang'd my dwelling, becauſe I was too much in the eye of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and caus'd them to be too jealous of me, which a <hi>Franc</hi> ought to be careful of, that he may not be cenſur'd and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted by them. I took a lodging near the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <pb n="151" facs="tcp:106091:79"/>dwellings, at a
<hi>Turks</hi> houſe, called <hi>Tatar Sciaban,</hi> who was a very honeſt man, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Religion.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Turks</hi> ſee a <hi>Franc</hi> in a Village or Country, chiefly where they never ſaw him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they imagine immediately that he is loaden with Diamonds and Pearls. They take therefore notice of all his ſteps, to find out ſome occaſion to quarrel with him; and of all places of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie,</hi> this happens moſt frequently in
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I was in the Town, the report ſpread about, that a rich <hi>Franc</hi> with a great Train was come. The <hi>Cadi</hi> thinking therefore that he had a perſon from whom he might draw a ſum of Money, becauſe he believ'd that I was a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant come thither to buy Wines in the Vintage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to carry them to <hi>Cairo,</hi> which Commodity is forbidden in all the Territories of the Grand Seignior, he deſired the <hi>Naib Gaibe,</hi> or <hi>Soubachi</hi> of the place, to endeavour to find out my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and to let him underſtand them; for he promiſed to give him half the money that he ſhould get out of me, if I did buy any Wines.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe the <hi>Naib Gaibe,</hi> or
<hi>Soubachi,</hi> a Renegade <hi>Fleming,</hi> who ſpoke well his Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue, came to my lodging with two Ruffians, and enter'd into my Chamber whiles I was taking out my Cloaths, and without ſaluting any body, ſate down in a Corner, which is the place that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Maſter of the houſe in the Eaſt-Countries: The Ruffians ſtood at the door, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their Staves. I was mightily ſurpriz'd to ſee ſuch a perſon come to viſit me. I called to my <hi>Janizary</hi> to know what he would have; he anſwered, that he underſtood that I was a <pb n="152" facs="tcp:106091:80"/>
                     <hi>Franc,</hi> and that he was come to know whether I would buy any Wine, becauſe he would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to that which was very good. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, that if he had no other buſineſs, he might ſpare himſelf the trouble and pains that he took, that I was never a Merchant of Wines, and would not now begin; and that we <hi>Francs</hi> care not much for the poor Wines of his Country. To this he held his peace.</p>
                  <p>He enquir'd what Countryman I was; when I had told him that I was of the City of <hi>Erford</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> he ſeem'd to rejoyce, becauſe he had found one in ſuch a far Country whom he might name his Countryman, for he ſaid he was of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> He promis'd me his friendſhip; we eat afterwards together, and I caus'd him to drink Wine as much as he would, which was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him: when the liquor had a little chear'd his ſpirits, he diſcover'd to me the deſign of the
<hi>Cadi,</hi> and the cauſe of his Viſit; by this means he became one of my beſt Friends in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and my ſafety whiles I continued in that Town, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom I ſhould not have eſcap'd the Train that was laid for me.</p>
                  <p>After a little reſt in my lodging, I ſought ſome means to ſtrike acquaintance with the Biſhop of the place, called <hi>Amba Michel,</hi> who had a very good repute of an honeſt and a learned man, becauſe I was deſirous to have ſome body to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, and to ſpend my time with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to my ſelf; I obtain'd this with eaſe, for he came a few days after and lodg'd at my houſe: I am much beholding to him for many things that he hath told me concerning their Belief and Ceremonies, which I have inſerted in my <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:106091:80"/>
                  <p>Let us now ſee the deſcription of the Town and Territory of
<hi>Fium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Town of <hi>Fium,</hi> the chief of the Province whereof it bears the name, is large and full of people: It is built upon the Ruines of the old <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> which is near adjoyning on the Weſt-ſide. Though the moſt part of the houſes are but little, and made of Bricks dried in the Sun, they are nevertheleſs commodious, and ſome, where the Officers and Commanders dwell, are large and beautiful. There be many <hi>Copties</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and a Biſhop, but no Church within the Walls; they perform their Devotions at <hi>Deſie,</hi> a Village near by.</p>
                  <p>An artificial Channel cut from the River paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through this City, from Eaſt to Weſt: They name it <hi>Bahr Juſef,</hi> or the
<hi>River of Joſeph,</hi> for they believe that <hi>Joſeph, Jacobs</hi> Son, caus'd it to be made. 'Tis call'd alſo <hi>Calitz il Menhi,</hi> or the
<hi>Channel of Menhi.</hi> This Channel is remarkable, becauſe it keeps freſh water all the year, which proceeds from ſeveral Fountains there, but it is too ſhallow to carry Boats but when the River overflows. It begins about three days journey from <hi>Fium,</hi> drawing towards the South, near a Village named <hi>Tarut Iſſcerif,</hi> where I have been. It runs, when it hath left the Town, into the Lake named <hi>Birket il Kern,</hi> or the Lake of
<hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> where the waters become ſalt.</p>
                  <p>In this Town are to be ſeen many Relicks of Antiquity, as Capitals, Antick Works, Pillars of Marble broken. In the Corn-market is to be ſeen a great Pillar, entire laid upon the ground, and a great Mill-ſtone, both of a red ſtone; and almoſt in all houſes is to be ſeen ſomething very remarkable for its antiquity.</p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:106091:81"/>
                  <p>Here is made much Linen for the houſe, and Canvas to pack up the Commodities of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: They have a great deal of Flax, which yields a great benefit; ſtrak'd Linen is plentiful here, and very good, with which the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people cloath themſelves. The Leather of this Country is much eſteem'd, but chiefly the Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets that are made here are the fineſt of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and are carried all over the world. Here are alſo made Sacks of Network of Cord, to carry upon Camels Straw, or dried Dung to burn, or Stones, or ſome ſuch thing, for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſe Carts.</p>
                  <p>This Territory is very fruitful and pleaſant, and all that grows here is of a better taſte than in the other Provinces. Here are Fields full of Roſe-trees, and Woods of Fig-trees, which are not in other parts of
<hi>Egypt.</hi> The Gardens are full of all manner of Trees, bearing Fruit; as Pear-trees, Orange-trees, Lemon-tree, Peach-trees, Plumb-trees, Apricock-trees, and many others that are ſent to be ſold at <hi>Cairo,</hi> which yields them a great profit.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Fium</hi> only, of all the Provinces of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are Vineyards; and in theſe Villages only, in <hi>Fidimin</hi> where I have been, in <hi>Nacalife, Seliin, Abukeſa, Agiamiin, Gerrado,</hi> and
<hi>Tobhar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They make Wine thus: They preſs the Grapes either with their Feet, or other wiſe, into a great Earthen Veſſel; they put afterwards the new Wine into a Sack of courſe Linen, and ſtrain it into another Veſſel; from thence they draw it, and ſecure it in Jars well pitch'd within, which contain about twelve thouſand Drams. Now theſe Jars they place in the Sun during ſeven days, <pb n="155" facs="tcp:106091:81"/>leaving them open, that the new Wine might purge it ſelf; they ſtop them afterwards with Palm-leaves, and cover them cloſe with Mud. They leave their Wine in this manner, till they intend to drink it.</p>
                  <p>This Wine is not much eſteemed of by the <hi>Francs,</hi> becauſe there remains ſo much dregs that come out into the Cup with the Wine; but if they had but the art of clearing and clarifying the Wine, it would be doubtleſs a very pleaſant Wine, for the Grapes are very ſweet, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the taſte.</p>
                  <p>I have not ſeen a Province in <hi>Egypt</hi> that is ſo much cut into Channels as this: They all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>Joſephs</hi> River, and they are made to water the Fields with more eaſe; and becauſe this great number of Ditches would hinder men from travelling up and down, were it not for the Bridges, here be more than in any other part of <hi>Egypt.</hi> They are all made with burnt Bricks, and very ſtrong: The Tradition ſaith, that they were builded in the days of the <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s; and it is the opinion of the <hi>Copties,</hi> that theſe Kings imployed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in making Bricks for theſe Bridges, which is very probable; for it is certain, that almoſt an infinite number of men are needful to make ſuch a prodigious quantity of Bricks.</p>
                  <p>This Province of <hi>Fium</hi> anciently had three hundred threeſcore and five Towns and Villages, but now there be but threeſcore and two; all the other have been ſwallowed up in the Lake <hi>Kern,</hi> or deſtroyed by the tyranny of the Governours.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Caſcief</hi> dwells in the Town: He pays now to the
<hi>Pacha</hi> five and twenty Purſes, and five <pb n="156" facs="tcp:106091:82"/>to his
<hi>Kehaja,</hi> or Lieutenant, and to his <hi>Agas.</hi> He pays for his Province two hundred purſes in four payments. The <hi>Divan</hi> of
<hi>Cairo</hi> allows him three Cornets of Horſe, or <hi>Spahins,</hi> to keep his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, unto whom he pays every ſix Months five and twenty
<hi>Piaſters,</hi> which is but a ſmall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; ſo that they are but poorly clad, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as ſo many Beggars, rather than as the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of ſo great an Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Town of <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> ſcituated near
<hi>Fium,</hi> on the North-Eaſt-ſide, is now totally rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated: There remains nothing of it now, but a great many Mountains very high raiſed, with the ruines and rubbiſh of the Town. They ſhew ſufficiently, that it was one of the greateſt and moſt glorious Cities of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The people of the Country call it, <hi>Medinet Fares,</hi> or <hi>the Town of the Perſian;</hi> but I could never underſtand the cauſe of this name.</p>
                  <p>They ſay that it was deſtroyed and burnt by Cats, which the Enemies ſet into it when they had tyed Fire-brands at their Tails, which ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the fire into every corner of the City, and burnt it to aſhes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> call it in their Books <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> calls all that Province, the <hi>Government of Arſinoe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 24th of this Month I went to <hi>Fidintin,</hi> a Village diſtant from <hi>Fium</hi> about two hours ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, towards the Weſt, to viſit the Biſhop, who was gone thither out of the <hi>Caſciefs</hi> ſight. I was cloathed in a Turkiſh habit, with a <hi>Janizary</hi> and a
<hi>Negre</hi> well armed, upon good Horſes. Our coming put the poor Biſhop into ſuch a fright, that he thought himſelf already kill'd, when he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106091:82"/>heard that three ſtrange Horſe-men ask'd for him. He thought at firſt that we were ſome ſent by the <hi>Caſcief</hi> to do him an injury. Theſe poor people are become wonderful timerous, through the continual tyranny of thoſe Barbarians, ſo that at the leaſt motion they tremble and ſhake. He was pretty well ſatisfied, when I told him that I was a <hi>Franc</hi> come purpoſely to crave acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him: He entertain'd us in a very poor dwelling, invited us into his Parlour, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with very good Wine of the Country. When we had ſpent ſome hours in converſation with him, we went to ſee the Vines of that Quarter, and in the Evening we return'd home to the City.</p>
                  <p>The 29th of the ſame Month I went to <hi>Bija<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muh,</hi> a Village about half a League from <hi>Fium,</hi> towards the North, to ſee an ancient thing, the Body of a great Statue of a Gyant, of a red Stone, without Head or Arms, ſtanding upon a Baſis. This Statue is behind the Village, in a great broad Road.</p>
                  <p>I could never learn what it is, becauſe the Country-people have no Tradition of it; and in the Hiſtories of <hi>Egypt</hi> there is no mention made of it. I have only learnt that the people of the Country call it the <hi>Statue of Pharaoh;</hi> which I think not to be true, becauſe it is the cuſtom of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to entitle all things of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary bigneſs with the name of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> from a conceit they have that they were all Gyants.</p>
                  <p>The Baſis of this Statue is ſquare, of hewn ſtones that are very great, every ſtone hath two foot and a half in breadth, and almoſt ten foot in length; the fore-front hath five Perches in length, that is about thirty foot.</p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:106091:83"/>
                  <p>Near this Baſis five others ſtand in a Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle, but leſs, and without any Statue upon them.</p>
                  <p>The Biſhop inform'd me, that heretofore in this Village was an
<hi>Agiaſma,</hi> or <hi>Fountain of holy Water,</hi> called by the Arab.
<hi>Ein il Mandura;</hi> and that every <hi>Holy-Thurſday</hi> a great many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were wont to meet there to drink of this Water out of devotion, but that the people of the place, who are all <hi>Mahometans,</hi> have ſtop'd it up, to prevent the continuance of this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
                  <p>When we had well ſeen theſe things, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Town, and in our way we went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Ruines of the ancient
<hi>Arſinoe,</hi> where I ſaw nothing remarkable, but ſome old Walls which my Guide told me were the remains of a Bath.</p>
                  <p>When we were come near the Town, we left it on the left hand, and went to ſee the <hi>Needle of Bibig,</hi> whereof this is the deſcription.</p>
                  <p>This Needle is placed on the ground, without any Baſis, in the middle of a Corn-field, in a place where is no houſe, nor mark of any that hath been there.</p>
                  <p>It is diſtant from <hi>Fium</hi> about a long half league, near a Village called <hi>Bibig,</hi> from whence it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows the name. This Village is ſcituated on the South-weſt of <hi>Fium,</hi> and belongs unto it.</p>
                  <p>It is built in a long ſquare, very high; its lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſides have ſix foot, and the narroweſt are of four. This Needle abuts not into a ſharp point, as others in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but the top is made like an Aſſes back: On the South-ſide, which is one of the largeſt, there are three ranks of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <pb n="159" facs="tcp:106091:83"/>that repreſent Men and Women holding one another by the hand: under theſe three ranks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin fourteen ranks of Hieroglyphick Characters, about the bigneſs of a finger, which are to be read from the top to the bottom; every rank is divided from the other, which is near, with a line that is drawn between, all along the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: So that without doubt this Needle is the moſt curious that may be ſeen. In every one of the leſſer ſides is but one rank of leſſer Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, which yet continue very clear and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing to be lamented at, that time hath almoſt blotted out the Figures, from the middle of the Pillar to the bottom; and that the Stones have not been able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from corruption, being much worn out: It is of a red Stone, as all others.</p>
                  <p>Its top is like an Aſſes back, and very large, ſit for the Vultures and Hawks to pitch upon it at night: Theſe Birds have ſo whitened it with their dung, that the uppermoſt Figures are ſcarce to be diſcern'd.</p>
                  <p>I have taken notice, that all the Needles that I have ſeen in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> ſtand not upon any Baſis, but upon the ground, which makes me believe that the invention of planting them upon a Baſis, is not derived from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but from the <hi>Romans,</hi> who having taken notice that this kind of Pillar was very uſeful, and contain'd great Myſteries in their Characters, they have rais'd them upon a Baſis, to render them more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and conſiderable to the curious. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Town about Noon.</p>

                  <head>A little Journey to <hi>Sennuris.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nday</hi> the 31. of <hi>July</hi> I went to
<hi>Sennuris,</hi> a Village belonging to the <hi>Caſcieflik</hi> of
<hi>Fium,</hi> ſcituate on the North of this Town, and about four hours travelling on Horſeback, to ſee the remains of Antiquity that are there, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; beſides my Servants, ſome other <hi>Copties</hi> Chriſtians went with me.</p>
                  <p>When I had a little reſted my ſelf at <hi>Sennuris,</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Sciech il Beled,</hi> the Chief of the Village, a
<hi>Moor,</hi> where my friends oblig'd me to take my lodging, I went to take notice of the Village, which is great, and very beautiful; and at the ſame time I ſaw the Church of the <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> dedicated to the Archangel
<hi>S. Michael,</hi> but it is very mean.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, I took notice there of one thing very remarkable, namely, a ſquare ſtone, where are three little Figures cut the firſt repreſents the Archangel <hi>S. Michael,</hi> the middle repreſents the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who holds in her Arms her Son, and the third the Angel <hi>Raphael.</hi> The names of every one is written underneath in Greek Letters, in the <hi>Copties</hi> Language. This ſtone is a foot and a half long from ſide to ſide: The Prieſts informed me, that this Stone was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Chancel, but when they ſaw that the people render'd homage to theſe Figures, they plac'd them in a corner of the Church, that they might hinder them from Idolatry. They offer'd it to me for a <hi>Piaſter</hi> and a half, becauſe I ſeem'd to value it at a high rate; I would not take it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had no intent to return ſo ſoon to <hi>Cairo,</hi> but to go further into <hi>Sayda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:106091:84"/>
                  <p>At the <hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of the Village, about a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-ſhot from it, is to be ſeen a very ancient Bridge of Bricks, made for a Paſſage for the River when it overflows. The People of the Country ſay, that <hi>Joſeph, Jacob</hi>'s Son, cauſed it to be built. It is apparent by its Ruines, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore it was very great, but now there remains no more but four Arches.</p>
                  <p>Round about this Village is ſown a great deal of Flax, but it is not eſteem'd ſo good as that which grows in other parts of
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At that time there was, as well as at, <hi>Fiúm,</hi> a want of freſh Water, becauſe the people of the Country uſually caſt into the River their Hemp, where they take their Water to drink; this had ſo poiſoned the Waters, that they did ſtink, ſo that I was forced to cauſe ſome freſh Water to be brought from <hi>Fiúm,</hi> which is about four hours diſtant from this Village.</p>
                  <p>In an evening I walk'd to ſee the Lake <hi>Kern,</hi> which is very near <hi>Sennúris,</hi> on the <hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide.</p>
                  <p>This Lake is narrow, but long, for I was told that it is about two days travelling for a Horſe, in length. This is doubtleſs the Lake
<hi>Miris</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Pliny,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Inter Arſinoïten Prafecturam, ac Memphiten Lacus fuit, circuitu CCL.M. paſſuum, aut ut Mutianus tradit, CCCCL.M. &amp; latitudinis L. paſſuum, manu factus à Rege qui fecerat Moeridis appellatus:</hi> For there is no other Lake between <hi>Fium,</hi> which is <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> and the City of
<hi>Memphis,</hi> or the place where it ſtood.</p>
                  <p>At its <hi>Eaſtern</hi> end is plac'd the Village
<hi>Tamích,</hi> mentioned before; and in its <hi>Weſt</hi> end is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Caſtle of <hi>Vizir Caron,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:106091:85"/>
                  <p>This Lake receives all the Waters that run from the Fields when
<hi>Nilus</hi> is overflown, and from the River of <hi>Joſeph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> they become ſalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Earth is full of Niter.</p>
                  <p>Here is much Fiſh, chiefly a Fiſh called is <hi>Arab. Houd,</hi> which I have deſcribed in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning the Fiſh of
<hi>Nilus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide of the Lake are Deſarts of Sand very large; I have heard from Perſons worthy to be believed, that there are to be ſeen many remarkable Ruines of ancient Towns, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of <hi>Temeh iſſebag,</hi> or of <hi>Temeh</hi> of <hi>Lieus;</hi> a Town ſo named becauſe of the Statues of <hi>Lieus</hi> that were there to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Here is alſo to be ſeen the Ruines of an ancient Monaſtery named <hi>Deir Abulífe,</hi> or the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of
<hi>Abulífe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They told me, that they had ſeen the Labyrinth which is at the end of the Lake <hi>Weſterly,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pliny,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>There was a Labyrinth in the Lake of Moeridis, built without any Wood.</hi> This Labyrinth is named now by the <hi>Egyptians, Caſſr Carun,</hi> or the Caſtle of <hi>Vizir Caron;</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lord in the Hiſtories of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Treaſures which are ſaid to be here buried, and kept by dreadful <hi>Taliſmans.</hi> They tell me, that this Caſtle hath three hundred and threeſcore and five Chambers, ſo intangled one into another that a man cannot get out, if when he comes in he doth not take notice of the way.</p>
                  <p>This Report gave me a great deſire to venture to ſee all theſe Wonders at any rate: I had already agreed with the Chieftain of the Village, to have from him a Guard of twelve Men, whom he knew
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106091:85"/>to be faithful and truſty; but my Janiſſary, a timerous Fellow, ſpoil'd my deſign, by ſhewing me the danger there was of the <hi>Arabians;</hi> he threatned likewiſe the Guard, to tell the
<hi>Caſcief,</hi> which would have created me ſome trouble.</p>
                  <p>I conceive that this Relation may beget a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in ſome Traveller to go and ſee this Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore I will give him a little advice which ſhall help him to accompliſh his deſign.</p>
                  <p>He muſt know, that he ought not to go to the Labyrinth from
<hi>Sennuris,</hi> or to the other ſide of the Lake, but to <hi>Senhur,</hi> a Village diſtant from <hi>Sennuris</hi> about an hours travelling; for there the Fiſher-men of the Lake <hi>Caron</hi> dwell, who are beſt able to carry Men thither: But it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needful that a <hi>Franc,</hi> who will undertake this Voyage, be well learn'd in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue, that he be well cloathed according to the Mode of the Country, that he may not be known, and chiefly let him diſſemble his deſign as much as he can; for if he fails in any of theſe particulars, he will doubtleſs be loſt. The
<hi>Moors,</hi> who are very jealous of the Treaſures that are ſaid to be there, will knock him on the head, that he may not carry them away.</p>
                  <p>I ſtaid three days at <hi>Sennuris,</hi> for the place did pleaſe me, and the Inhabitants were very civil. I return'd to <hi>Fium,</hi> ſecond day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> very much diſpleas'd with my Janiſſary, becauſe he had croſs'd my deſign.</p>
                  <p>On the ſecond day of this Month the Water of <hi>Nilus</hi> enters into the Channel of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which paſſeth through
<hi>Fium,</hi> as we have ſaid. Then its Waters are purified, and purged from its ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualities which the Flax and Hemp give it: <pb n="164" facs="tcp:106091:86"/>Then the Ciſterns of the Town are fill'd with Water, which the Inhabitants drink all the year long, therefore this inundation makes all the people of the Country round about to rejoice.</p>

                  <p>BEtween the Towns of <hi>Fium</hi> and <hi>Beneſuef,</hi> which are diſtant the one from the other about a little days Journey, there be two great <hi>Pyramides;</hi> the one is near <hi>Fium,</hi> the other nearer to <hi>Beneſuef.</hi> The firſt is named <hi>Haram Havara,</hi> the
<hi>Pyramide</hi> of <hi>Havara:</hi> The other <hi>Haram Ila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hun,</hi> the
<hi>Pyramide</hi> of <hi>Ilahun.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the 4th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I went to that of <hi>Havara,</hi> ſo called from the neighbouring Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
<hi>Havara.</hi> It Stands about an hour and a halfs walking from
<hi>Fium,</hi> on the South ſide, ſcituated in a ſandy Wilderneſs, like that which is over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Cairo,</hi> where the <hi>Pyramides</hi> ſtand: when we were gone beyond a certain Bridge of Brick, very old, which is upon the Highway of <hi>Beneſuef,</hi> we left it, to take a ſhorter courſe; but we found cauſe to repent it, becauſe the way was craggy and full of Sand.</p>
                  <p>We were oblig'd alſo to go through the <hi>Bahr Belame,</hi> or the River without Water, which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to endure much trouble and fear, in regard of the depth that was extraordinary, and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to climb up again. And when we had overcome all theſe difficulties, and were near the
<hi>Pyramide,</hi> about ſix hundred Paces from it we met with a Ditch of the River of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> full of Water; we could not get over it, but were forced to ſtay <pb n="165" facs="tcp:106091:86"/>on that ſide, and from thence take a vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w, at a diſtance, of the
<hi>Pyramide,</hi> to my great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I took notice, that in its elevation and breadth, it was much like the ſecond <hi>Pyramide</hi> which is at <hi>Gize,</hi> but the length of time hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reduc'd it to Duſt, ſo that it appears like a ſharp Mountain of Sand, rather than a
<hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Deſart where it ſtands, is like that of the
<hi>Mommies</hi> which is near <hi>Saccàra.</hi> Some Wells of
<hi>Mommies</hi> are here to be found, whereof the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is fill'd up with Sand, and ſome are half empty. Upon the ground are ſcattered, here and there, Bones of <hi>Mommies,</hi> broken Wood, and pieces of Coffins; ſo that one may ſay that it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like that of <hi>Saccàra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe we were without any Guide, and my Janiſſary was a very Coward, having none but him with me, he allarm'd me ſeveral times with the fear of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> beſides, our Beaſts were tired with the deep way; I was therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to ſet bounds to my Curioſity, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Town, paſſing through the River with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Water, near its Mouth, leaving on our left hand, near the <hi>Pyramide</hi> of
<hi>Havara,</hi> the Ruines of an ancient Town, whereof I could never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the name; and a little further, on the ſame ſide, the Village of <hi>Havara,</hi> from whence this <hi>Pyramide</hi> borrows the name, and at a little diſtance from this Village, a very ancient Bridge, and very high, which is made to give a paſſage to the River <hi>Nilus</hi> when it overflows: We return'd to <hi>Fium</hi> again about Noon.</p>
                  <p>For the other <hi>Pyramide,</hi> called of <hi>Ilahun;</hi> the
<hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtorians ſay, that <hi>Joſeph, Jacob</hi>'s Son,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106091:87"/>cauſed into be built. It is ſo nam'd from the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
<hi>Ilahuis,</hi> near adjoining, belonging to the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieflik</hi> of
<hi>Beneſuef;</hi> but becauſe I could not look upon it, but at a diſtance, I cannot well deſcribe it. The Reader may ſee what

                  <head>A Walk to the Monaſtery <hi>Caſciabe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ON the 19th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> I went to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of
<hi>Caſciabe,</hi> diſtant from <hi>Fium</hi> about two hours walking, or thereabouts, drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> in the Wilderneſs, called by the <hi>Arabians, Gebel Naklon,</hi> or <hi>the Mountain of Naklon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In our way to this Monaſtery we went over ſeveral Bridges of Brick, very ſtrong, made by the ancient <hi>Egyptians:</hi> And we left at our right hand at the entry of the Wilderneſs, which is about half way, the Monaſtery of <hi>Deir il azeb;</hi> and a little further, at our left hand, the Ruines of an ancient Town overthrown, of which I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learn the name.</p>
                  <p>The Monaſtery of <hi>Caſciabe</hi> is very ancient; it is almoſt totally ruinated, unleſs it be the Church dedicated to the Arch-Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> which is very beautiful, and painted in the inſide with the Paſſages of holy Writ. The top of this Church is ſupported by Pillars that ſtand at a diſtance, and of divers Stones. Under this Church is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that I could not ſee, becauſe the Proviſions of the Monaſtery were there ſhut up.</p>
                  <p>This Church was built by one named <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Ibraſcit,</hi> a very famous Magician; who, <pb n="167" facs="tcp:106091:87"/>as the
<hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtories relate, had this Child by a Daughter of an Eaſtern King. When at laſt this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> had left the Art of Magick which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had taught him, he addicted himſelf to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſo that afterwards he became Biſhop of <hi>Fium,</hi> and built this Church, and Tradition ſaith, that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> laid the Foundation-ſtone of the Church, and of the Altar, and the Archangel S. <hi>Michael</hi> mark'd out the Quire, and the reſt of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Many remarkable things happened whiles this Church was building; I mention them not for brevity ſake, they that will underſtand them, may read the <hi>Arabian</hi> Manuſcript mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now in the Kings Library.</p>
                  <p>On the top of the Mountain, behind this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, on the South-ſide, are yet to be ſeen the ruines of an ancient Town, which the
<hi>Copties</hi> ſay was inhabited by the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> and for this cauſe they name it yet <hi>Modſellet Jacub,</hi> or the Tabernacle of
<hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A little higher, upon the ſame ſandy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, are to be ſeen many Caves where the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits anciently lived; I went into ſome of them out of curioſity, they are very little, and there is in them nothing extraordinary: when I had taken a view of all that was remarkable, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Fium</hi> in the Evening.</p>
                  <p>The Country had been ſome days dround about <hi>Fium,</hi> which oblig'd the Commanders of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and the
<hi>Caſcief,</hi> to retreat to <hi>Cairo.</hi> And becauſe the Robbers are very formidable at this time, and commit many diſorders, I was oblig'd to return alſo to <hi>Cairo.</hi> I went from <hi>Fium</hi> the 16th of
<hi>Auguſt</hi> in the morning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned <pb n="168" facs="tcp:106091:88"/>the ſame way that I came, and the next day I was at <hi>Cairo</hi> in the Evening, after five and twenty days abode at <hi>Fium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At my return to <hi>Cairo,</hi> I began my <hi>Church of Alexandria;</hi> a very curious work, and very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the world, and chiefly to the Learned that deſire to underſtand how the Churches of the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> agree with the <hi>Roman.</hi> It contains all the Ceremonies and Doctrines of the Ancient and Venerable Church of the <hi>Copties,</hi> which is that of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> I have taken them out of two Manuſcripts in <hi>Arab.</hi> very ancient and rare, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us in
<hi>Europe</hi> before now; the one is called <hi>il Mosbah iddolme d' Abulbaracat,</hi> and the other, <hi>il Giauharet innefiſſe fielm il Keniſe.</hi> I have been very exact and diligent in compoſing this Book, that it might render my name immortal. I ſhall endeavour to give it to the Preſs as ſoon as I ſhall be return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I make my ordinary abode.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> which was the third
<hi>Friday</hi> after the opening of the <hi>Calitz,</hi> a skilful Swimmer cauſed himſelf to be admired of all the City, by a very bold action; he had his arms tyed behind his back, his feet tyed at an Iron Chain, which weighed ten pounds: In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ventur'd to ſwim upon his back, from the mouth of the <hi>Calitz.</hi> to the end of the Town, which is about three quarters of an hour walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a-foot.</p>
                  <p>This cuſtom hath been anciently us'd in <hi>Cairo:</hi> A skilful Swimmer performs this every year, two <hi>Fridays</hi> following after that the <hi>Calitz</hi> is open'd. The <hi>Pacha</hi> gives him for his reward a thouſand <hi>Meidins,</hi> which make three and thirty
<hi>Piaſters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:106091:88"/>
                  <p>The Guards of the <hi>Soubachi</hi> went before him in a Boat, to hinder him from receiving any harm: about five and twenty other Boats full of Spectators followed. He ſwum this year but once, becauſe <hi>Ibrahim Pacha,</hi> who loved not ſuch uſeleſs expences, commanded him away when he came to demand his ordinary wages; therefore inſtead of a thouſand
<hi>Meidins,</hi> he gave him but one hundred.</p>
                  <p>There is another that ſwims in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as this, from the beginning of the <hi>Calitz</hi> to the end of the City. He had his feet tyed with a Chain, a Diſh of Coffee in one hand, and a Pipe of Tobacco lighted in the other, at his mouth. The <hi>Pacha</hi> uſually gives him the ſame reward; but becauſe the former had not had his uſual Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this laſt would not this year ſhew his dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I was told that theſe Swimmers eat nothing for three days but Cich-Peaſen, and that they ſwallow their breath ſo long time, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their Bellies to ſwell, and become light as an empty Bladder. I was told alſo, that ſometimes they kill themſelves, or at leaſt become very ſick.</p>
                  <p>On the 12th of <hi>September</hi> the <hi>Pacha</hi> cauſed the Treaſure of the Grand Seignior to depart for <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with its ordinary guard and pomp.</p>
                  <p>There were one and thirty Mules loaden with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coyn, and <hi>Zequins</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> This Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure amounts uſually to one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Purſes, and each Purſe to five hundred Crowns. The <hi>Sangiac-Bey</hi> that carries it is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to expend all the Moneys needful for this Voyage, and it coſts him uſually one hundred Purſes, or fifty thouſand Crowns. The <hi>Caravan</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:106091:89"/>begins to march in the beginning of the Moon and arrives at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> at the end of one hundred days.</p>
                  <p>This Treaſure is taken firſt out of the <hi>Carache,</hi> or Tribute of the Lands and Villages which the Farmers Rent of the <hi>Divan;</hi> for all the Lands of <hi>Egypt,</hi> unleſs it be the Patrimony of the
<hi>Moſques,</hi> and the Lands belonging to <hi>Micha,</hi> are the Grand Seigniors, becauſe he conquer'd <hi>Egypt</hi> with the Sword. 2. It is taken out of the <hi>Douanes</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of <hi>Roſetta,</hi> of
<hi>Bouquir,</hi> of <hi>Damietta,</hi> of <hi>Brullos,</hi> of
<hi>Boulak,</hi> and of <hi>Ibrim.</hi> 3. Out of the <hi>Chordis.</hi> 4. It is taken out of the Lakes and Pits of <hi>Nitre,</hi> which are in the Deſart of S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius,</hi> and out of the Salt-pits near <hi>Alexandria.</hi> 5. From the Shambles of <hi>Cairo,</hi> whereof I have already ſpoken. 6. From the Cuſtom-houſe or <hi>Douane</hi> of the <hi>Bohars,</hi> or
<hi>Spices;</hi> and generally from all Merchandizes imported from <hi>Mecha, Mocoa,</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi> 7 From the <hi>Mint.</hi> 8. From the
<hi>Giavali,</hi> or Tribute which the Chriſtians of the <hi>Levant,</hi> and the <hi>Jems</hi> are oblig'd to pay for their Heads. 9. From the Treaſure called <hi>Beit il mal,</hi> which comprehends all the deceaſed goods. 10. From the Office of Surveyor of the Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day I ſaw the Moſque of <hi>Califfe Hakem be amr ille:</hi> It ſtands out of <hi>Cairo</hi> upon the Mountain called <hi>Gebel il mocattam;</hi> but now there appears nothing but the Walls.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Califfe</hi> had made near this Moſque a place to obſerve the courſe of the Stars, named in <hi>Arab. Raſſad ve Mofatek beta Hakem,</hi> which is now ruinated; he made uſe of it to make his
<hi>Taliſmans,</hi> as art in which he was very skilful. <pb n="171" facs="tcp:106091:89"/>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſay that he could go in and out into all the Caves under ground, where he knew the Treaſures of the ancient Kings and Lords of <hi>Egypt</hi> to be hid, and that he could make uſe of them when he pleas'd; and that by the power of Magick, and the extraordinary skill that he had in that Art.</p>
                  <p>According to the example of thoſe great men, a little before his death he buried his own Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and put a Crocodile made by the Taliſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Art to keep them.</p>
                  <p>In this Mountain, and near this Moſque, he cauſed ſeveral Caves to be digg'd wide and large in the Rock, ſo as to paſs from one into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in the furthermoſt he cauſe a Pond to be made to keep water in, cut in the Rock; in it is a Crocodile that begins to fly at one as ſoon as a man enters in. Moreover, in the bottom of the water, is to be ſeen a door which leads to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caves under ground, where the Records of <hi>Egypt</hi> declare that his Treaſures are hid. No man can imagine from whence this water can come, for the Cave is upon a high Mountain which is very dry always, and in this place is no Spring: And it is not known what this Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile is, and how he may be nouriſhed, during ſo many ages. To take this Treaſure, you muſt know how to undo this Taliſman, that is, one muſt take away the water, and the life of the Crocodile; for both are the effects of Magick, which depend upon the Art of the Taliſmans.</p>
                  <p>I have been very diligent in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſeek for, and ſend to <hi>Paris,</hi> amongſt other rare Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, the ancienteſt and beſt Authors of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which might give ſome light and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106091:90"/>knowledge of this Noble Science. I may ſay that I have emptied <hi>Egypt</hi> of ſuch kind of Books, with an intent that if I was ever admitted to the ſervice of him who had given me this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I might have the time and the means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover with eaſe the admirable ſecrets of this Science, and to unfold the Enigms under which it lies hid; and by the ſame means to diſcover of what conſequence thoſe Manuſcripts are, though they are deſpiſed by ſome that underſtand not neither their price nor uſe.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may peruſe an <hi>Arabian</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript in
<hi>Quarto,</hi> called, <hi>Eijun it hekajek, ve eidah il terajek,</hi> of
<hi>Meimun</hi> the Magician that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the means to deſtroy all manner of Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. He may read another in <hi>Octavo,</hi> called, <hi>Kitab gaiet il maareb, Fi menajeh ve il chabaia, ve il medaleb,</hi> that diſcovers the places of all the Treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their value, the Figure of the Taliſman that keeps them, and how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; I have ſent them both to the Kings Library.</p>
                  <p>On the 12th and 20th of <hi>September,</hi> I went to ſee the Great Aqueduct, called in <hi>Arab. it Migro,</hi> that conveys water from the River into the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi>'s Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>This Aqueduct is near <hi>Nilus</hi> in old <hi>Cairo;</hi> the Mouth there ſtands a Caſtle of a Hexagone Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure very high, ſupported by as many Arches very lofty. There is an aſcent through a large way, open towards Heaven, made ſloping about, for the conveniency of the Oxen that draw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the River, and cauſe it to mount up by ſeven Wheels as high as the Platform on the top of the Caſtle, where there is a large Pond
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106091:90"/>or Baſon to receive the water, and about it ſeven great holes like Wells, which have given the name to this Caſtle of the
<hi>Seven Wells.</hi> The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter runs from this Baſon into the Aqueduct, which appears, and from thence it goes into the <hi>Caraffe,</hi> which is at a great diſtance, where it meets with the Earth as high as the Aqueduct; and then it ſtops there, and runs next into a Channel under ground to the
<hi>Pachas</hi> Stable, from whence it runs into his Ciſtern, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>This Aqueduct is ſupported by three hundred and ſeventeen high Arches, and not by three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty, as a certain Traveller ſaith, for I have exactly number'd them my ſelf: They are made as well as the Caſtle of great ſquare ſtones, cut as we do Diamonds: One of the Supporters on the chief ſide is about eight foot nine inches broad, and under the Arch it is only eight foot. The opening of one of the Arches is fourteen foot and a half broad.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> ſay that <hi>Mekaukes,</hi> a famous man of their Nation, and Governour for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Heraclius,</hi> made this Aqueduct, but they are miſtaken; for when this man governed in
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Cairo</hi> was not in being, for it was built four hundred and forty four years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and therefore this Aqueduct that now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it with water was not then needful; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Inſcriptions in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that this is a work of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kings; if I be not miſtaken, I have read that it was Sultan <hi>Gauri,</hi> the laſt King but one of the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melukes,</hi> that cauſed it to be built.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pacha</hi> taketh out of the Revenues of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106091:91"/>Grand Seignior all that is needful to keep up this Aqueduct; for that purpoſe be nouriſheth threeſcore Oxen, and gives wages to five men and a <hi>Ciurbachi</hi> that looke after it.</p>
                  <p>On the 13th of the Month of <hi>September,</hi> I went to viſit the Patriarch of the <hi>Copties,</hi> one of my beſt Friends; and becauſe I had often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to come and dine with me, I reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the ſame intreaty now again; but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me, that he had not been out of his houſe a year before for fear of the <hi>Turks:</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, that all the Patriarchs of the other Sects had the liberty to go about the Town, without fear of being diſturb'd by any, to viſit whom they pleas'd, and to travel whither they liſted; but he was ſo narrowly obſerved by the
<hi>Turks,</hi> that he could not ſo much as go out of his houſe, nor talk with any of other Nations openly, much leſs travel into any other place, but he muſt give them a jealouſie of plotting againſt the State; by this means his life would be in danger.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs confeſs, that there is no Nation in
<hi>Egypt</hi> ſo much afflicted as are the <hi>Copties,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no body amongſt them who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be honoured for his Knowledge, or feared for his Power and Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all that were rich and wealthy, are deſtroyed by the cruelty of the <hi>Mahometans:</hi> therefore the reſt are now look'd upon as the Scum of the World, and worſe than the
<hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> abuſe them at their pleaſure; they ſhut up their Churches, and the doors of their Houſes when they pleaſe, upon light occaſions, altogether unjuſt, to draw from them ſome ſums of Money.</p>
                  <p>There was ſuch a tyrannical Action practiſed

                  <p>They endured another Cruelty in the ſame Year; for <hi>Pacha Ibrahim</hi> increaſed their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tax in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Till this Year they were not all obliged to pay the ſame Sum of Money. They were not all bound to pay it into the Treaſury of the Grand
<hi>Seignior;</hi> for ſome were bound to pay it to certain
<hi>Moſques,</hi> othere to <hi>Sciech il Becri,</hi> who is a great Lord, and comes from <hi>Abn Becr, Califf,</hi> or Succeſſor of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and others to other Lords, called in <hi>Arab. Sadats.</hi> They that payed to the <hi>Moſques,</hi> or Lords, were called <hi>Lay-Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries:</hi> And they that payed to the Treaſure of the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi> were called
<hi>Tributaries of the Grand Seignior.</hi> The firſt ſort of Tribute is very moderate, becauſe it ſeldom amounted to above two <hi>Piaſters;</hi> but the laſt hath always been, and is yet, one hundred and twenty
<hi>Para's,</hi> that is, four <hi>Piaſters</hi> and a quarter. Beſides this, the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and Towns were taxed only in common: For Example, ſuch a Village was tax'd to pay ſuch a Sum, according to the number of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that dwell there; and when the <hi>Chouli,</hi> or the Collector, went to receive it, he tax'd every one according to his ability: The poor paid lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the rich more; ſo that this Tribute was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:106091:92"/>
                  <p>But in this Year 1672. <hi>Ibrahim Pacha</hi> taxed them all as Tributaries to the Grand <hi>Seignior;</hi> and upon the ſame account cauſing them all to pay equally one hundred and twenty <hi>Para's;</hi> out of which the <hi>Pacha</hi> paid that which was due to the Lords and
<hi>Moſques,</hi> and the reſt was put into the Grand <hi>Seigniors</hi> Coffers.</p>
                  <p>This novelty hath reduc'd the poor <hi>Copties</hi> to deſpair; therefore when the Collectors come into any Village to gather the Tribute, they fly to the Mountains, leaving all to ſecure themſelves from violence, and affronts that would be done to their Perſons.</p>
                  <p>That the Receivers of the Tribute might know them that have paid it, they leave a little Ticket of coloured Paper, ſealed with the Seal of their Chieftain, where the name of the Chriſtian is written, his Village, his Province, his Dwelling, his Age, the Day, the Month, and the Year that he hath paid.</p>
                  <p>But they put not into this Ticket the whole Sum of one hundred and eight and twenty <hi>Para's,</hi> which they require, but only one hundred and three, becauſe there is no more that goes into the Treaſury of the Grand <hi>Seignior;</hi> the other five and twenty <hi>Meidins</hi> are for the Farmer of the <hi>Caraffe,</hi> paid to him becauſe of the great expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he is at, to entertain a great many Men for the diſcharge of his Office. The Chriſtians carry always with them this Ticket, to ſhew it when they are queſtioned by the Men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Farmer, and this is their Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>The 18th of <hi>September</hi> I bought, of an <hi>Arabian,</hi> a great <hi>Lizard,</hi> alive, called in their Language, <pb n="177" facs="tcp:106091:92"/>
                     <hi>Varal.</hi> I cauſed it to be skinned, and ſent the Skin to Monſieur <hi>Arnoul,</hi> Superintendent of the Kings Galleys at
<hi>Marſeilles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The body of this <hi>Lizard</hi> was altogether like that of the
<hi>Crocodile,</hi> the Skin excepted, which was gray and ſpotted, as that of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> and without any Shells. It was three-foot long, and had five Fingers to each Foot, and long white Nails, as have the
<hi>Crocodiles.</hi> Its Tongue was forked as that of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> the Headlong, and the Muzzle ſharp. Its Teeth were ſtrong, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; the
<hi>Arabians</hi> told me, that its biting was venomous and deadly.</p>
                  <p>I have ſince recover'd another of a differing ſort, when I was in the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Anthony.</hi> The Head of this was like that of a <hi>Tortell,</hi> and its Tail very big, and leſſening by degrees, and ending into a ſmall point. It was full of knots round about, as ſo many Shells. This <hi>Lizard</hi> was not venomous, for I took it with my Hand, and when I had well conſider'd it, I gave it to an <hi>Arabian</hi> Dog that eat it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſaw nothing remarkable in this way. The Villages, and Monaſteries, before which we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were the Convent or <hi>Deir il aduvie</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, the Convent of the Abbot <hi>Berſum il erian,</hi> or or <hi>S.

                  <p>He that will travel to the Monaſtery of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> ought firſt to land at <hi>Beneſuef,</hi> and enquire from the Chriſtians of that place, whether the ways be free or not.

And if at any time any other croſs intereſt hath blinded them to commit any perfideous Action, God hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them at the ſame inſtant for it with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſo that they would have wiſh'd that they had kept their Faith, as the Reader may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by what follows.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Price that he is to give them, he ought to grant them ſome quantity of Beans for their Camels, and give them ſome
<hi>Meidins</hi> to buy Sandals, for the ways are full of ſharp ſtones: He ought to buy them ſome Meal, black Bisket, ordinary Hony, and Tobacco, as much as will be needful, to accompliſh the Voyage, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Men. He muſt not forget every Morning and Evening to give a Diſh of Coffee to every one; if he delivers it generouſly, and freely, he may promiſe to himſelf a happy Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and to be well tended. The <hi>Arabians</hi> have the care to provide Veſſels to greaſe, and fill them with the River-water, for there is none to be found in the way; or if there be, it is ſo noiſome, and ill-taſted, that it is not drinkable.</p>
                  <p>There is two ways that lead from this Village <hi>Beiha,</hi> to this Monaſtery. The firſt called, by the <hi>Arabians, il Tarik il Kihli; the upper way:</hi> and the other <hi>il Tarik il bahri, the under way;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this Village from whence they ſet out.</p>
                  <p>The under way is the ſhorteſt, the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and that which the <hi>Caravan</hi> takes, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the bank of the River for a while; and when one leaves it, the way turns at the right hand
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106091:94"/>into the Wilderneſs, to a place called <hi>Gibei.</hi> There is the firſt Well which Nature hath digged deep in a firm Rock, into which the Rain-water runs; which Water is white as Milk, and ſweeter than that of <hi>Nilus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About a days Journey farther is another, at the left hand of the High-way, at the foot of a high Mountain, called <hi>Gebel il cheleil;</hi> but its Water is noiſome and green, and the We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> is full of Canes. A little farther is another, very well known to Travellers, becauſe it is near the Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a famous
<hi>Arabian</hi> called <hi>Eid il beidavi;</hi> but the <hi>Caravan</hi> never goes thither but when they want Water, becauſe it ſtands from the High-way, at a diſtance: Therefore when they are furniſhed with Water at the ſecond Well, they paſs at the left hand ſtreight to the Monaſtery.</p>
                  <p>The upper way leads from <hi>Beiha</hi> towards the
<hi>South-Eaſt,</hi> and after a day and a halfs travelling it goes to the
<hi>Eaſt.</hi> In this way are neither Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor Trees, nor Houſes, nor Graſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is needful to make good Proviſion of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at
<hi>Beiha</hi> for the whole Journey.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, knowing this before, I took at <hi>Beiha</hi> a Camel purpoſely to carry Water, and four o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for me and my followers, the
<hi>Abyſſin,</hi> the <hi>Coptie,</hi> and <hi>Idris</hi> my
<hi>Blackamoor.</hi> Beſides theſe, I took with me five <hi>Arabians,</hi> armed with Lances, to go on foot, and take charge of the Camels; and to protect us, if perchance any Robbers ſhould have aſſaulted us; ſo that we were in all ten in number, and five Camels. When we had got all that was needful for the Voyage, we went from <hi>Beiha</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> the 30th of
<hi>September,</hi> about three a Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:106091:94"/>
                  <p>Though the under way was the ſhorteſt, and the moſt frequented, yet we choſe the upper way, that we might not meet with the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> the declared Enemies of thoſe that conducted us. When we had travelled four days through a boundleſs Plain of Sand, which was not move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but hard, and full of ſharp cutting ſtones, that cut as ſo many Razors, we arrived at laſt, through a thouſand turnings, to the Monaſtery, the third day of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Monaſtery of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> which includes another, anciently peopled by the <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> and now totally ruinated, is in the Wilderneſs, now called in <hi>Arab. Gebel Araba,</hi> or the Mountain of Carts; becauſe heretofore Proviſions were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thither upon Carts, and not upon Camels, as now.</p>
                  <p>It is built upon the decline of the Mount <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi> at its <hi>Eaſtern</hi> end, which reaches from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to
<hi>South:</hi> It appears like a long Square; and the Front of the Monaſtery, which ſtretches from <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> to <hi>North,</hi> looks againſt another Mountain called <hi>Gebel il Cheleil,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>
                  <p>It is incompaſſed in with an high Mountain, but feeble, and unable to make any reſiſtance; for it is old, and built with Bricks dried in the Sun. There is no Gate to the Monaſtery, one enters in by a Pulley, Men and Beaſts are all drawn up over the Wall.</p>
                  <p>It hath a large Circuit, about ſix hundred <hi>Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans,</hi> or two thouſand four hundred Acres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls.</p>
                  <p>The Monks of the <hi>Levant</hi> dwell not together in the ſame Cells, as thoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> but every <pb n="182" facs="tcp:106091:95"/>one hath a little Houſe or Cell to himſelf, and theſe Cells are more or leſs beautiful and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, according as the Country hath experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the cruelty of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Therefore the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries of the
<hi>Levant,</hi> and chiefly thoſe of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> are like ſo many great Towns or Caſtles, becauſe of their Walls, Turrets, and number of houſes that are within; but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries of <hi>Egypt</hi> have nothing of that ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, becauſe the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have been here more cruel than in any other Country ſubject to them. Nevertheleſs, this Monaſtery is like thoſe of <hi>Greece,</hi> for it is ſurrounded with Walls: In the middle is a Dungeon, and round about many Houſes where the Monks live; but in regard it has been deſtroyed long ago by the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> it hath remain'd in that condition threeſcore and ten years: The <hi>Copties</hi> who have loſt, under the tyranny of the
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> all their ſtrength and power, could never yet reſtore it to its former eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Cells now are very little, and poor, of yellowiſh Earth, without Timber, Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Order, or Symmetry: they are ſo low, that a man may eaſily reach up to the top with his hand: therefore the Monks cannot well ſtand upright: there is a little light that enters in through holes in the wall, about a foot long; the doors are ſo low, that one muſt ſtoop low to go in; that which is moſt commodious, is that they have all flat roofs for the Monks to take the air at night, when the Sun is gone, and to ſleep when they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>Their dining-place is very dirty, and obſcure: There is for Strangers a place of it ſelf, large <pb n="183" facs="tcp:106091:95"/>and decent, with two other Chambers hard by to put their Goods and Cloaths; and a little Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin.</p>
                  <p>The Gardens are very large, and great, and conſiderable, becauſe of the Herbs and Fruits that they bring forth. One might make of them the moſt pleaſant Gardens of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their convenient ſcituations, for they lie ſhelving, with beautiful Plains.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſmall Vines that yield a ſort of White-wine, very delightful: They uſe it in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Maſs, and in treating Strangers of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that come thither.</p>
                  <p>In this Monaſtery is a great quantity of freſh water, as clear as Cryſtal, but very ſalt. It runs from the Mount <hi>Colzim,</hi> near by, in little ſtreams, under the Walls, into the Gardens, where they receive it in places made on purpoſe. They drink it, and make other uſes of it. It is not very wholeſome, chiefly for thoſe that are not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to it; for the <hi>Niter</hi> that infects it, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Bladders to riſe under the Skin, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuch as drink of it with itching, as I have found by experience.</p>
                  <p>Here are three Churches, the chief is that of S.
<hi>Anthony;</hi> it is little, but very ancient; and as the Monks told me, it is the ſame that S. <hi>Anthony</hi> built, and the only thing of the Monaſtery that hath eſcap'd the rage of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> Within are Pictures of many Saints, painted in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and ſimple faſhion: The ſmoak of the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe that is burnt there at Divine Service, hath made them appear as black as a Chimney.</p>
                  <p>Near this Church is another dedicated to S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> within a little Tower, and one <pb n="184" facs="tcp:106091:96"/>Bell, about a foot and a half in Diameter: ſerves to call the Monks to the Service of God, and to their other imployments. There is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bell in all
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Church is in the Garden, dedicated to a Lay Monk, called <hi>Mark,</hi> who died with a Reputation of Holineſs; his body is kept there.</p>
                  <p>In the middle of the Monaſtery there is a ſquare Tower, with ſtone Walls, very ſtrong; from the bottom of the Tower to the Gate, which is about three Perches high, it is very firm: on the top is a Draw-bridge that leads to this Gate; but to come to it, one muſt climb up to the top of an houſe, over againſt it. In this Tower the Monks keep all their Proviſions, and their beſt Moveables; and they fly to it when the Roguiſh
<hi>Arabians</hi> threaten them: They then draw the Bridge, and beat them off with Stones from the Plat-form.</p>
                  <p>Their Rule obliges them to renounce Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for ever, all carnal deſires, their Parents, to poſſeſs no Eſtate, to dwell in the Wilderneſs, to be cloathed with Wooll, to be girt with a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Girdle, to eat no Fleſh, nor drink Wine all their life-time, unleſs they be reduc'd to the laſt neceſſity, to ſhorten their dinner, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves all the nouriſhments without which the body is able to live. It commands them to imploy all their time in faſting, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and worſhip, to have always their mind run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon God, to apply themſelves to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Scriptures, and to underſtand the Truths that are there contain'd.</p>
                  <p>It obliges them to ſleep upon a Mat, or the ground, their Superiour excepted, and ſuch as <pb n="185" facs="tcp:106091:96"/>are ſick; not to take off their Cloaths, and their Girdle, never to ſleep two upon the ſame Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nor near one another. In ſhort, their Rules oblige them to repeat the Canonical Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to proſtrate themſelves before they go to Bed, one hundred and fifty times, with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Bellies to the ground, to ſpread out their arms in a croſs, with the fiſt ſhut, and at every riſing to make the Sign of the Croſs; which Proſtrations they call
<hi>Metanoe.</hi> Beſides theſe one hundred and fifty Proſtrations, they perform ſeven at the Church; one before every Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prayer, which make up in all one hundred and fifty ſeven Proſtrations; which together with the poor nouriſhment that their bodies take, renders them very lean, and caſt down; ſo that they appear like ſo many Skelletons, rather than men.</p>
                  <p>Their Cloaths are firſt a Shirt of white Wooll, which they wear always upon their skin. 2. A Waſtcoat of brown Wooll, very courſe, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before. 3. A Veſt of black Serge, with two large Sleeves. 4. Their Capuchin is likewiſe of black Serge, very little, and made fit to the Head.
5. Their Girdle is of Leather, three ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers broad. 6. The <hi>Mezerre,</hi> called by the <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>

I have ſent one of theſe <hi>Askims</hi> to the Kings Library, which
<hi>Amba Michel,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Fium,</hi> gave me as a token of his love.</p>
                  <p>They carry always a ſtick in their hands, made in the form of a <hi>Tan,</hi> T, upon which they lean when they are at their prayers; for they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them ſtanding, and are very tedious in them. They have all upon their heads a Bonnet, called in <hi>Arab. Cauk,</hi> which is like that which the <hi>Mahometans</hi> wear; about which they wrap a Turbant of a Stuff ſtraked with blew and white, which is the colour of all the <hi>Copties</hi> in <hi>Egypt:</hi> They never wear any Stockings, nor their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch.</p>
                  <p>The Faſt-days they obſerve, by eating then but one Meal; but on the <hi>Saturdays</hi> and <hi>Sundays</hi> they never faſt, but eat twice. On the Faſt-days they dine conſtantly about three a Clock in the Afternoon; then they end Maſs.</p>
                  <p>Their ordinary diet are Pulſe and Herbs ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the ſtinking Oyl of Hemp: For their Deſſerts they have Fruits, as Onyons, dried Dates, rotten Olives, Melons, or Cucumbers, or Pompions, or ſuch like Fruits as are in ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>They never eat Fleſh in the Monaſtery; but when they are out they may eat it; for their Founder never forbad them, as they ſay: For freſh Fiſh they ſeldom have any, becauſe their Monaſtery is ſo far diſtant from <hi>Nilus,</hi> and there is no convenient carriage to bring them any. And though the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> be within a little days
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106091:97"/>Journey, they cannot have any freſh Fiſh, becauſe the Sea-coaſt being not inhabited, they have no Inſtruments to catch Fiſh; and the ways are dangerous, becauſe of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Rogues and Robbers.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Eaſter</hi> they never faſt, but eat Eggs and Milk, which are ſent to them from their Farm; only three times a year they have liberty to drink Wine, at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and
<hi>Pentecoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſleep always in their Cloaths; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Blanket, they have only a Mat, very courſe, made with Palm-leaves, and ſtretched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long upon the ground. They are the makers of them; they call them in <hi>Arab. Burſch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their imployments are not the ſame, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every mans ability: Some manure and dreſs the Gardens, others are Cooks, others grind at the Mill; ſome are upon the Guard, to give notice when any Travellers go by, or come, and others are appointed to draw up thoſe that will come in, and let down thoſe that deſire to depart; ſuch as have no imployment, make Mats.</p>
                  <p>They never ſtudy; they are ſatisfied in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Books of Devotion: amongſt the reſt, they read often the <hi>Synaxar,</hi> or
<hi>Book of Martyrs;</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of Monks,</hi> the
<hi>Climax,</hi> or <hi>the Ladder of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> of <hi>John, Abbot of the Monaſtery of Mount Sinai;</hi> the Sermons of <hi>Paul de Buſch,</hi> upon the Feſtivals of the Bleſſed Virgin, and ſuch like. When I was there, I ſaw but two Prieſts, the Vicar of the Monaſtery was one; and the other, who had not ſaid his firſt Maſs, was the Steward. All the others, that were ſeventeen in number, were Lay-men, and almoſt all either with one eye,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106091:98"/>deaf, lame, and halt, or worn out with old age; and if amongſt them any were young, he did but ſeek the opportunity to eſcape from ſuch auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
                  <p>In the Tower, mentioned before, were three or ſour Trunks full of old <hi>Arabian</hi> Manuſcripts, and ſome in the <hi>Copties</hi> Language, which I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd: And though they were all Books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion belonging to the Church, ſome of them deſerved to be in the Kings Library; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Monks were not willing to fell them, for they belong'd to the Monaſtery, fearing the Excommunication of their Patriarch, which is written in the beginning of every Book; and becauſe I had brought with me but ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as was needful for my Journey, for fear of the Thieves, I was not very earneſt to buy them.</p>
                  <p>Two amongſt the reſt were very curious, which I had a great deſire to have; one was the <hi>Copties</hi> Grammar and Dictionary in
<hi>Arabick,</hi> of <hi>Ibn il aſſal.</hi> It was one of the exacteſt and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt that ever I faw: They eſteem'd it worth thirty Crowns; I dare ſay, that with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionary and Grammar it is poſſible to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the <hi>Copties</hi> Language, which now is loſt: The other Book was a <hi>Rubrick of their Ceremonies</hi> in <hi>Folio,</hi> very well written.</p>
                  <p>In regard the <hi>Arabians</hi> are the Maſters of the Wilderneſs, this Monaſtery is obliged to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all that come thither, or paſs by, whether Friends or Foes: To their Friends they pay this hoſpitality to preſerve their friendſhip, and to their Enemies they perform it, to pleaſe them, and hinder them from doing them a miſchief. They treat not all in the ſame manner; for their <pb n="189" facs="tcp:106091:98"/>Friends they take them in with their Equipage, when they have need, and they nouriſh them all the time that they deſire to live there; but their Enemies never enter in, but receive from them, by a Basket let down from the Wall, all neceſſaries.</p>
                  <p>They are often viſited by theſe <hi>Arabians,</hi> ſo that they ſpend every year a great deal of Meal, of Bread, of Bisket, of Barly, of Beans and Lentils, and other Proviſions. I ſhall not mention the trouble that the Monks ſuffer, and the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that they receive from theſe ungrateful Wretches, who commonly recompenſe them with affronts, and filthy ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the <hi>Arabians</hi> that inhabit about
<hi>Egypt</hi> are of divers Families, and differing Intereſts; they have ſo great a hatred for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they never meet without fighting.</p>
                  <p>Such a miſchance happen'd the next day after my arrival; for the <hi>Caravan</hi> of the Summer, of fifty Camels, loaden with Proviſions for the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, led by thirteen Horſmen of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> named
<hi>Benevaſel,</hi> arrived that day. They were watched by other
<hi>Arabians,</hi> named <hi>Ababde,</hi> their Enemies. And becauſe it was the time that the Dates began to be ripe upon the Trees, ſome of them when they had unloaden would not return the ſame day, with their Companions, to their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and Cabbins, but remain'd behind in the Monaſtery, to take their pleaſure a day or two. It happen'd the next night that thoſe that ſlept out of the Monaſtery, about their Beaſts, were ſurpris'd at midnight, by a Company of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore <hi>Arabians,</hi> called
<hi>Ababde,</hi> who took from them fifteen Camels, and ſeven Horſes, all their Equipage, and kill'd three of them, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="190" facs="tcp:106091:99"/>five, of whom one dyed within three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and another was loſt, none knowing what was become of him; for four days after his Horſe was found alone in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>Their fury ended not with this Butchery; for they purſued, with the ſame heat, thoſe that had brought me to the Monaſtery. They overtook but four, and carryed away from them their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, all their Equipage, and Money that I had given them, and wounded three very dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo that theſe Wretches being not able, in this ſad condition, to proceed on in their Journey, they return'd back to the Monaſtery all naked, and in a pitiful manner. They were afraid to appear before me, becauſe they had falſified their Faith, contrary to the Laws of their Nation, and broken their agreement with me, in making me pay five and twenty <hi>Meidins</hi> more than I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with them. Their Conſcience did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them of this baſeneſs, ſo that they imagin'd that this miſchance happen'd to them to puniſh their perfideouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſufficiently expreſs how much trouble this unhappineſs created me, as well as to the Monks; for theſe
<hi>Arabians</hi> were enraged, ſome for the loſs of their Parents and Friends, others for their Goods, which they were reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover upon me and the Monks. They threatned to kill them, to plunder the Monaſtery; and out of a perſwaſion that I was a very rich <hi>Franc,</hi> they threatned to break open my Door, and carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all that I had. So that the Monks had much ado to pacifie them, by giving the Shirts, Cloaths, Caps, Girdles, in a word, all that they wanted; and when they had nothing more left to give<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:106091:99"/>they came to me, intreating me to help them in their need; ſo that I was oblig'd to give them a Coat, and a Shirt to bury an
<hi>Arabian</hi> that dyed in the Monaſtery. I gave them a red Cap, a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, Money very often, that I might not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by thoſe Monks who deliver'd all to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> without telling them from whence it came.</p>
                  <p>But at laſt the <hi>Arabians</hi> were jealous, when they ſaw that I continued ſhut up, without ſhewing my ſelf abroad, either to them, or any other of the Monaſtery; and my privacy made them believe that I was ſome great Perſon that was afraid of them. They reſolved therefore to give me a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, to know who I was. As ſoon as the Vicar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood their intent, he came to give me notice of it, that I might take a courſe accordingly. As ſoon as I underſtood it, I cauſed all my Goods to be carried into the Tower of the Monaſtery, leaving nothing in my Chamber but a courſe Mat of Palm Leaves ſtretched upon the Floor, upon which I ſate without Carpet or Cuſhion: And that they might not think me to be a
<hi>Franc,</hi> I took the Habit of a Monk of that Convent. In this manner I expected them, not without fear. The next day about noon, three of the chief enter'd into my Chamber with their <hi>Cangians,</hi> or
<hi>Cutlaſſes,</hi> at their Girdle in their Boſoms. They ſaluted me with a ſurly look, asking how I did. I anſwer'd their civility as well as I could; I cauſed them to ſit down near me, and told them that I was griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their misfortune, and that I was not able to aſſiſt them in their need. I exhorted them to truſt upon God and S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was as well their Father and Protector, as of the Monks; <pb n="192" facs="tcp:106091:100"/>and that doubtleſs he would comfort them, and give them one day the opportunity to overcome their Enemies. Theſe words pleaſed the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> mightily.</p>
                  <p>I caus'd my Dinner to be brought, and though I had with me all my Proviſions needful from <hi>Cairo,</hi> I ſuffered nothing to be brought but Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils in a Wooden Diſh, with Bread ſoaked in it, and a few Onions, I intreated them to eat ſome with me: They needed not much invitation. One may imagine what was in my mind, when I had ſuch Gueſs at my Table; but fear cauſed me to diſſemble my thoughts.</p>
                  <p>After Dinner I gave them Pipes to take Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, and Coffee according to the Mode of the Country, which pleaſed them well, chiefly in this place where little of that Drink was to be ſeen. When theſe
<hi>Arabians</hi> ſaw me ſo free and hearty, they conceived ſuch an affection for me, that they promis'd to protect me, if any of their Comrades ſhould offer to affront me. When they had talked with me ſome hours, they went away very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and told their Comrades how civil I had been. By this one may underſtand, that there is no Nation in the World ſo barbarous; but is to be won by fair means.</p>
                  <p>Some days before; the <hi>Arabians</hi> had ſent ſome of their Company to their Parents, to inform them of their loſs, and to intreat them to ſend them Beaſts to help home their ſick and wounded. That day they received an anſwer, that ſuch of them as could return home on foot ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that the others ſhould continue there till they were cured of their wounds; and that none durſt come, or ſend them Beaſts, for fear of loſing <pb n="193" facs="tcp:106091:100"/>them. Therefore theſe Wretches when they ſaw that they could not remain any longer in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, reſolved to depart together, as ſoon as their ſick Perſons ſhould recover any ſtrength. I reſolved alſo to be gone; for the little ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I found there, took away all deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue there any longer; for I had cauſe to fear, leſt the news of this Maſſacre ſhould ſpread about the Wilderneſs, which might have cauſed me to ſtay there all the Winter, for want of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to carry me away. I haſten'd therefore my departure as much as I could, and hired three Camels of an <hi>Arabian</hi> that was left behind in the Monaſtery, who alone was able to furniſh us: I was to give him a <hi>Piaſter</hi> and a half a-piece; moreover I promis'd to give him a new Suit of Apparel for an <hi>Arabian</hi> of our Company that had been ſtripp'd, whoſe Kinſman he ſaid he was: We confirm'd our Agreement before all the Monks, by the Chapter of <hi>Fatha,</hi> according to the Cuſtom of the Country; and then I cauſed my ſelf to be let down from the Window of the Monaſtery, on <hi>Munday</hi> the 17th of
<hi>October,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with joy a place where I had met with many diſpleaſures. We took the way and road of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> or the under way, becauſe the Camels that I had hired lived that way. The
<hi>Arabian</hi> that was to be my Guide having but one in the Monaſtery, the two others being near his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was in a Clift of Mount <hi>Gebel il che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leil,</hi> over againſt the Monaſtery. We went to this Lodging, or about a days travelling from thence, in a way very difficult and deep; and becauſe this <hi>Arabian</hi> was a right Devil of the Mountains, as they term themſelves in boaſting. <pb n="194" facs="tcp:106091:101"/>As ſoon as we were a little forwards in our way, he told me that the Price that we had agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not ſufficient, and that I muſt promiſe him as much more. I refuſed to grant him his deſire, which was contrary to all reaſon and juſtice, he led us therefore two days up and down in the Wilderneſs, ſometimes one way, ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, threatning to leave us and go away with his Camel, or to carry us back to the Monaſtery: all this was to force me to give him what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. I had much difficulty to hold my hands from ſtriking him, which I had done, had we but known the way, and where to recover Water; but conſidering that I was loſt if I did abuſe him, I was forced at laſt to conſent to his deſire, upon this Condition, that he ſhould remain at home and give us another Perſon to guide us in our way; for he was of ſuch a crooked diſpoſition that it was impoſſible to perform the Journey peaceably with him, which accordingly he did. When we had thus ſatisfied him, he became of a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and led us to his Dwelling, where his Wife and Children came to ſee us, and prepared for us a Supper, according to the Mode of the <hi>Arabians;</hi> his Boys brought us ſome Wild-Fowl, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me with a young Fawn alive, which I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with me to
<hi>Cairo.</hi> Thus we ſpent that night very pleaſantly.</p>
                  <p>The next day we cauſed him to repeat the <hi>Fatha</hi> the ſecond time. He gave us a <hi>Moor</hi> to conduct us, of a very good humour. We went with him on our way, and arrived at <hi>Beiſa</hi> the 22th of
<hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> from whence we had been abſent 22 days. I paſſed immediately over to the other ſide of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to <hi>Beneſuef,</hi> and lodg'd under a Tent, with a <pb n="195" facs="tcp:106091:101"/>
                     <hi>Turk</hi> my very good Friend, on the ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> till the 26th of
<hi>October.</hi> I went aboard then to return to <hi>Cairo,</hi> where I landed the next day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpent 31 days in my Travels from thence.</p>
                  <p>I never undertook any Journey, or Voyage, that was ſo full of accidents, and croſſes, as this.</p>
                  <p>The conveniency of a Guide cauſed me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it. He was a young <hi>Abyſſin,</hi> of my Age, named <hi>Paul,</hi> a comly Perſon, wiſe and devout in appearance. I had a little before got acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him; and becauſe he underſtood by my diſcourſe, that I had a great deſire to viſit the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> where he ſaid he had been before, and that I expected but a Guide, becauſe the ways were difficult for a <hi>Franc</hi> who had never been there, chiefly becauſe of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> a brutiſh and fantaſtick People, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his ſervice to accompany me thither. And the rather I accepted his offer; becauſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had a particular reſpect for the honeſt Men of his Country.</p>
                  <p>We reſolved therefore upon all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our Journey, and left <hi>Cairo</hi> the day mentioned before. But the familiarity ordinary amongſt fellow Travellers diſcovered to me his diſpoſition and temper, more than I could before; for all his viſits at <hi>Cairo</hi> were ſtudied and crafty. I found therefore that he was a diſſembler, and without judgment, too haſty; I reſolved therefore to ſhake him off, and to ſeek another, to prevent the miſchiefs that his indiſcretion might procure tome.</p>
                  <p>I met at <hi>Beneſuef,</hi> very happily, a <hi>Coptie</hi> born at <hi>Buſch,</hi> by Profeſſion a <hi>Mebaſcier,</hi> or Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, who had travell'd all about the upper <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:106091:102"/>I found him fit for my turn, I ask'd him to be my Guide in this Voyage; he accepted of the offer, and I paid him beforehand. When the
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſin</hi> underſtood it, he was highly offended; ſo that he endeavour'd afterwards to be reveng'd, by cauſing a diſturbance amongſt us, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd the Company againſt him.</p>
                  <p>The firſt night after our departure from <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuef,</hi> when we lay in the Wilderneſs, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my Servant, contrary to my orders, to give no Coffee to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> as if a Diſh of Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, given to theſe Wretches, would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh'd me. They plotted to cut his Throat, and doubtleſs he had there ended his days, had I not perceived it betimes and ſatisfied them; for as they are extreme brutiſh when they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd, they are very quiet when they are flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd and kindly us'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> caus'd me, againſt their wills, to ſuffer another inconveniency. They took no care when they greas'd the Leathern Bottles of Water, that the Greaſe was mouldy, it infected therefore the Water ſo much which we were to drink, that I could not poſſibly taſte of it: let any Man think if this was not a ſufficient mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing our Journey, or Voyage, laſted five days.</p>
                  <p>As this was the firſt time that I rid upon a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, I could hardly endure the ſhakings, which the manner of walking of this fantaſtick Beaſt cauſed me to ſuffer. I confeſs, when I ſaw my ſelf upon this Coloſſus, without any ſtay, lifted up in the Air, ſeated upon an ugly Beaſt; my Feet in two Ropes inſtead of Stirrups, holding in my hand a Cord made with the Strings of a Palm-tree, <pb n="197" facs="tcp:106091:102"/>which cut my hands, it ſeemed to me very ſtrange: I reſolved nevertheleſs to overcome all theſe difficulties; and inſtead of vexing my ſelf, I made a ſport of that which would have troubled other Perſons.</p>
                  <p>When I think upon the ſolemn reception of the Monks, when I firſt came into the Monaſtery, I cannot but be yet diſpleas'd at my
<hi>Abyſſin.</hi> This Fool deſired me to let him go before the
<hi>Caravan,</hi> to tell the Monks of my coming, and to cauſe a Chamber to be prepared for me; but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects they paid me, I underſtood that he had too much exaggerated my quality, thinking to do me a pleaſure. I indeavoured to undeceive them, and cauſed all their Ceremonies to ceaſe, as ſoon as I perceived that they took me for a greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than really I was.</p>
                  <p>I have already ſet down at large how the
<hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bïans</hi> frighted me in the Monaſtery; but they were not the only Perſons that troubled me. The Monks, the Vicars, the <hi>Copties,</hi> and the <hi>Abyſſins</hi> vex'd me one after another, as if they had all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to try my patience.</p>
                  <p>The avaricious Monks, not contented with what I had given them, before my departure cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Vicar to tell me, that they expected that a
<hi>Franc</hi> of my reputation would have left them at leaſt thirty golden
<hi>Ducats</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> When I told them of the great charges I had been at in this Voyage, beſides the expences that I was yet to be at in my return; that I had received but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſatisfaction from them; that I wonder'd at their boldneſs, to tax a Stranger of my quality, that came from far to ſee their miſerable Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and their poverty. They were angry at <pb n="198" facs="tcp:106091:103"/>this anſwer, and treated me afterwards with contempt.</p>
                  <p>The Vicar was afraid to want Bread in his Monaſtery; therefore he reſolved to quit it, and to ſeek another where he might be better treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And becauſe he had no money to hire a Camel to carry him through a tedious and troubleſome way, he intreated me to give him ſome, which I did very generouſly, though I had cauſe to be offended with him. But he put this money in his Purſe, without dreaming of hiring a Camel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that my men would ſuffer him to ride ſometimes upon their Camels: But in the way he found himſelf deceived; when he was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his feet cut with the ſharp ſtones, he mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured at me; I told him of his covetouſneſs, unworthy of a man of his Profeſſion, of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle love for his Flock, whom he left in the time when they needed moſt his Fatherly care, but he received theſe reproofs very ill; ſo that from thence it may eaſily be imagin'd, how we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd together.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Abyſſin</hi> and the <hi>Coptie</hi> were at a continual variance, becauſe one thought himſelf more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me than the other; ſo that at every foot, I was oblig'd to make peace between them.</p>
                  <p>The night before the <hi>Arabians</hi> viſited me, I was oblig'd to cauſe all my Cloaths to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Tower of the Monaſtery, into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure place. In that hurley-burley I loſt ſome, valued at five or ſix <hi>Piaſters;</hi> I cannot tell whoſe fault it was, the <hi>Abyſſin</hi> caſt the fault upon the <hi>Coptie,</hi> to diſcredit him with me: However, as ſoon as we were come to <hi>Beiha,</hi> the <hi>Coptie</hi> vaniſh'd away ſuddenly, without bidding us farewell.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106091:103"/>This cauſed me to ſuſpect that the
<hi>Abyſſin</hi> had not accuſed him wrongfully.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe diſpleaſures we muſt add the fear of Thieves in the way; for at every ſtep, we look'd on the ground to ſee whether there were any footſteps in the Sand; when we ſaw ſome that were freſh, we were then grievouſly afraid; but our apprehenſions increaſed, when we ſaw the footſteps turned our way, for we imagin'd that we ſhould meet them; fear alone made us take Beaſts at a diſtance for Men, and Buſhes for Robbers that waited for us.</p>
                  <p>At laſt we were in ſight of <hi>Beiha,</hi> we imagin'd then that all our fears were over; but the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels knowing the Fields where they were wont to feed, began to leap for joy, becauſe they were return'd to their ordinary Paſtures; ſo that the Saddle of that upon which I rid being not well girded, nor the Bridle ſufficient to ſtop the Beaſt, it jolted, and caſt me up into the Air ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times: at every moment I thought I ſhould tumble down, and break my Neck, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd not, through the care of the <hi>Arabian</hi> that ſtopt the Camel.</p>
                  <p>This Relation is ſufficient to make it appear, that if there is ſome pleaſure in travelling, and ſeeing Forreign Curioſities, one buys them very dear, with the hazard of many dangers and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, chiefly in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where cruelty and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm ſeem to dwell.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add ſome other Curioſities which I have ſeen in the Deſarts.</p>
                  <p>We left at our left hand when we came from the Monaſteries, the ruines of a very ancient Town, ſcituate on the top of the barren Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <pb n="200" facs="tcp:106091:104"/>called, <hi>Gebel il cheleil.</hi> This Town is in the mid-way between <hi>Beiha</hi> and the Monaſtery, in that place where the Mountain ſeparates it ſelf, and by which one paſſeth in coming or going from <hi>Beiha,</hi> in the way of the <hi>Caravan.</hi> The
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> were ignorant of the name, and we had no time to ſtay there, having taken notice upon the Sand, of freſh footſteps of Horſe-men that had paſſed that way, which cauſed us to conceive ſome danger, if we continued there any time.</p>
                  <p>I found there a Plant, which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call
<hi>Barnub:</hi> It hath a little full Stalk, as a <hi>Mouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and at the top a little Butron, about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Nut, which is full of Powder, which the <hi>Dyers</hi> uſe in dying. Its leaves are as ſlender as the leaves of Poppy; I gathered three or four of theſe Plants, but I could not keep them long, becauſe of their tenderneſs. I ſaw alſo an Herb which is called by the <hi>Arabians Rabl,</hi> that ſmells as <hi>Mint,</hi> my <hi>Arabians</hi> fed upon it. I ſaw there a great deal of
<hi>Alcali,</hi> called in <hi>Arab. Kilu,</hi> which hath the virtue to take away from Cloaths all manner of ſpots. Upon the Mount <hi>Colzim,</hi> there is a Wood that grows, called <hi>Oud il akrab,</hi> or <hi>Scorpions Wood,</hi> the Monks of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> reduced it to powder, which they judge to be a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the biting of venomous Creatures, as well as to cure weak eyes, and eyes inflamed: They gave me half a pound in Canes; I have ſent it to <hi>Paris</hi> with the other Curioſities. In this Deſart is a great deal of <hi>Coloquinte,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sand much white ſalt very good, which my <hi>Arabians</hi> uſed to ſeaſon their <hi>Fatir,</hi> and their
<hi>Mafruca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fatir</hi> are great Cakes, as thick as finger, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106091:104"/>as large as a <hi>French</hi> Hat, baked in the Coals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mafruca</hi> is made of the <hi>Fatir,</hi> by breaking it in pieces, when it is yet hot, and taken from the fire; and by pouring upon it Oyl-Olive, and kneading it with the hand in a wooden diſh, as if it were Paſte. My <hi>Arabians</hi> imagin'd to do me a great pleaſure to offer me ſome to eat, for this is highly eſteem'd amongſt them; but though I had a good Stomach, I had not the courage to taſte of it, for I had good cauſe to loath it.</p>
                  <p>I return now to ſpeak of the things that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd at
<hi>Cairo,</hi> where I landed the 30th of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctober.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That day they began the <hi>Zine,</hi> or <hi>Feſtival of publick joy,</hi> becauſe the Grand Seignior had taken <hi>Caminiez</hi> from the <hi>Poles.</hi> This Feſtival laſted from <hi>Sunday</hi> till
<hi>Thurſday</hi> in the Afternoon.</p>
                  <p>It is the cuſtom at <hi>Cairo,</hi> that in ſuch like Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals every one adorns the out-ſide of his Houſe or Shop with Carpets and Pavillions, lighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them all night many Lamps tyed to wooden Engines, ſome made in an <hi>Hexagone</hi> figure, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in an
<hi>Octogone;</hi> ſome as Stars, others in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner. Theſe Engines are ſuſpended with Ropes tyed croſs the Streets, which are beautiful to look upon. The Streets in all other times are ſhut in the night, but then are open, and the Chriſtians, during this Feſtival, may walk about more freely than at other times at mid-day, becauſe one cannot diſtinguiſh in that obſcure light of what colour is the Turbant that they wear, nor diſcover whether it be ſtraked, or all white.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Lamps and Carpets, the <hi>Beys</hi> hang up in a good order before their Palaces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <pb n="202" facs="tcp:106091:105"/>the Walls; their moſt beautiful Armour, as Head-pieces, Breaſt-plates, Coats of Male, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, Hangers, Targets, and other ſuch Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of War. The
<hi>French</hi> Conſuls, who never come ſhort of them, cauſe beautiful Carpets to be hung in all the Streets of their dwellings, and Pavillions over the Streets, from one end to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to keep off the heat of the Sun. Monſieur <hi>de Tyger,</hi> Conſul of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, cauſed a kind of a reſting place to be erected, beautifying it with Carpets and Cuſhions, to receive the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality; he put round about the Pictures of the King, of the Queen, of the Dolphin, and other <hi>French</hi> Lords, in ſmall ingravery, with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers before them, to cauſe the
<hi>Turks</hi> to admire the wit and invention of the <hi>French,</hi> who can make Pictures much like the Originals. But the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſurprized to ſee their Beards ſhaven off; they ask'd whether they were yet Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Feſtivals give much diverſion to the people, but they are very chargeable to thoſe that will obſerve them, chiefly to the Conſuls; for beſides the Tents and Carpets, and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments that they muſt hire, they are wont to give Coffee and Tobacco to all that come to ſee them; and if they be perſons of Quality, they muſt have Sweet-meats: ſo that if a Conſul will come off with Honour, it will coſt him three or four hundred Crowns. The people run about the Streets, from morning till three hours after mid-night, all the time of the Feſtival.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt of <hi>November</hi> I went to ſee the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Cairo</hi> with a <hi>Chiaoux,</hi> a very good friend of mine.</p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:106091:105"/>
                  <p>The firſt thing that we ſaw was the Royal Hall, where the
<hi>Pacha</hi> keeps the <hi>Divan.</hi> He ſhewed me in the middle of this Hall, a great Cord tyed double to one of the Beams of the Roof, where, according to the cuſtom of the Country, the <hi>Caſciefs</hi> that have not ſufficient to pay the Taxes of their Province, at the end of the year are lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the air, with their hands behind, tyed to their backs: beſides, they are whipt upon their naked backs with a Whip of Cords, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto are tyed ſome Leaden Bullets.</p>
                  <p>We went up next to the top of the Ovens where they bake Bread, from whence the place called <hi>Kara,</hi> or the place of exerciſe, is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable. There the <hi>Pacha</hi>'s men ſport themſelves with Bows and Arrows, and by running on Horſe-back, aiming at a mark fixed at the top of a very high Tree.</p>
                  <p>We went to ſee next the Chambers where they make the Gun-powder, which are two great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours or Rooms on the ground, over againſt the Royal Hall of the <hi>Divan,</hi> with very ſtrong walls, and vaulted over head. In each are twelve Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of Pewter placed round, about a Cubit high, with their Peſtels of Iron, which receive their motion, to pound the matter in the Mortars to powder, from a long Pole that anſwers to a Beam that ſtands in the middle of the Chamber, which a Horſe turns round. There are near ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Chambers, where are many little Mortars, in which they refine the Gun-powder.</p>
                  <p>On the 19th of <hi>November</hi> I was preſent at a Marriage of two <hi>Copties;</hi> the Ceremonies were performed in this manner.</p>
                  <p>After the Oration or Prayer of mid-night, or
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106091:106"/>as if we ſhould ſay, after Morning-prayer, the Friends and Parents led firſt the Bridegroom, and next the Bride, from their Houſes to the Church, with ſeveral lighted Tapers before them, and ſinging through the Streets Hymns in the <hi>Copties</hi> Language, and ſtriking with little wooden Hammers againſt ſome ſticks of Ebony wood, which is their Muſick.</p>
                  <p>When they were come to the Church, they led the Bridegroom into the inner Chancel, where uſually the Prayers are ſaid, and brought the Bride to the place of the Women: Then the Prieſts and the People began in the Chancel their Prayers mingled with Hymns, which laſted very long: At the end, he that performed the Ceremony of the Marriage, went to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and read three or four Prayers, making over him the Sign of the Croſs, before, and at the end of every Prayer. He cauſed him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to ſit on the ground, having his face turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the <hi>Heikel,</hi> holding behind him upon his Head, in a ſtanding poſture, a Silver Croſs, and continuing in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Whiles this was doing in the Chancel, the Beadle cauſed the Bride, with one of her Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, to ſit down upon a Bench that he had there put out of the door of the uttermoſt Chancel. As ſoon as the Prieſts had ended in the innermoſt Chancel, the <hi>prayers of the Knot,</hi> as they name them. He that performed the Ceremony, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the Bridegroom with a Surplice, and tyed him about the middle with a Girdle, putting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head a white Cloth.</p>
                  <p>In this manner he led him to the Bride, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to ſit by her: He then covered them <pb n="205" facs="tcp:106091:106"/>both with this white Cloth, and made them put their heads together. Then he anointed the Bridegroom with Oyl-Olive in the Forehead, and above the Fiſt, and the Bride in the ſame manner: Afterwards he cauſed them to give one another their hands, reading aloud the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that contains the Duties which they were to perform to one another. So with a long train of Prayers, interrupted with ſeveral Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, this Solemnity of Marriage ended, which they call the
<hi>Coronation of the Married Couple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards they read Morning-prayer, or as we call them, the
<hi>Laudes.</hi> They ſung next Maſs, where the Bridegroom and the Bride received the Communion; which being ended, they all returned to their ſeveral homes.</p>

                  <p>THE night of the 16th of <hi>January,</hi> 1673. the
<hi>Copties</hi> celebrate the Feſtival of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphany.</hi> I was then at <hi>Cairo</hi> in the Church of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moncure,</hi> to ſee how they dip themſelves in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in remembrance of the Baptiſm of our Lord and Saviour, which was performed that night according to the Traditions of the Church. I took notice of theſe Particulars.</p>
                  <p>They ſaid the Prayers of Midnight, where the Font ſtands, and where they dipped themſelves, which they call <hi>il Magtas.</hi> This Pond, or Baſon: of Water is in a Chamber near the Church, about three Perches ſquare, as deep as a Man is high. As ſoon as Prayers were ended, the Patriarch went to the <hi>Kolomie,</hi> or <hi>Veſtry,</hi> to put on his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical <pb n="206" facs="tcp:106091:107"/>Attire; from thence he return'd to the Water, with a Deacon and a Prieſt before him. The Deacon had on him a Cape, bearing in his hand an Iron Croſs, as long as a Paſtoral Staff. The Prieſt was Cloathed with a Surplice, that he might be uſeful to the Patriarch in ſaying of Maſs; that is, that he might be his aſſiſtant, and Maſter of the Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>When he was come to the Water, he began to bleſs it, by reading over it ſeveral Leſſons taken out of the Prophets and the Pſalms, and out of the New Teſtament; ſometimes in the <hi>Copties</hi> Language, ſometimes in <hi>Arabick.</hi> The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch perfum'd it alſo, and ſtirr'd it croſs-wiſe with the Paſtoral Staff of Iron, which the other Prieſts did alſo, every one in his turn. And whilſt they were bleſſing this Water, which laſted near two hours, there was a Candleſtick of Iron ſtanding within, about the length of a Man, with three Branches, upon which there were three Tapers burning all the time of this Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as this bleſſing was ended, the Pond, or Baſon, was all uncovered, that the People might go in and dip themſelves. Then there was heard a ſtrange confuſion and noiſe, ſo great that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd; for every one endeavoured to be one of the three firſt, whom the Patriarch dips in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They that could not obtain this honour, dipp'd themſelves, skipping and playing, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, in the Water, without having any thing to cover their nakedneſs, and privy Members; and all this in the preſence of their Patriarch, and many Prieſts that were there.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Men had ended their waſhing, and were gone to the Chancel; the Women, and <pb n="207" facs="tcp:106091:107"/>the Maids drew near, and followed the Mens Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, skipping all naked in the Water, and ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one with the other. It is true that ſuch as did thus dip themſelves were of the poorer ſort, and that as many as were of the wealthier, and better ſort, waſh'd their faces and hands.</p>
                  <p>When the Women had ended their bathing, they went away to their own places to hear Maſs, which was already begun.</p>
                  <p>Thus this Ceremony was performed, which I ſaw from the beginning to the end.</p>
                  <p>The 26th of this Month Monſieur <hi>de Tyger,</hi> who had been, till then, Conſul of the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, left <hi>Cairo.</hi> He is a very able Man, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands his duty very well; but the Merchants of <hi>France</hi> made their complaints againſt him at Court, and caus'd him to be diſmiſs'd. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Bonnecorſe,</hi> the Couſul of

They cauſed themſelves to be wondered at by their howling and grimaces, for they wagg'd their Heads, their Eyes, and their Mouths, in a thouſand ways; others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the word <hi>Hu,</hi> which is one of the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Names of God, with all the ſtrength of their body; and there was none without Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, a Club, or a Halberd, or a wooden Sword, or ſome other ruſty Weapon.</p>
                  <p>After this Crowd came the Cloth with which they cover

                  <p>This <hi>Mahmel</hi> was made like a Bed, but the kind of Stuff, and the colour, was not to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, becauſe it was all covered with Flowers, and <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters, very long, all Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Gold and Interwoven very artificially.

                  <p>The Camel that carried this Engine, was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by five others: Upon the firſt was mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an <hi>Arabian,</hi> ſounding a Trumpet; upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a <hi>Moor</hi> that plaid upon two Cymbals; and upon the three others, three young Boys; after theſe went five and twenty

<hi>Mortuary,</hi> or <hi>Burying-Cloath,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered, ſquare, ſtretched upon Staves; next went four others that carried every one upon their ſhoulders a Cloath of the ſame faſhion. They told me, that they hanged them up where they celebrate the memory of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Eight and twenty <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> went next, two and two, with their Caps upon their heads. They went immediately before the <hi>Emir hag,</hi> or the Bey that commands this <hi>Caravan.</hi> This Bey was cloathed with a

His Domeſticks, who were twelve Archers well cloathed, and a Troop of Muſqueteers on Horſes, waited upon him; after followed the Drummers, the Trumpeters, the Pipers, either on Horſeback, or riding upon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels; and at laſt there was an Engine, drawn by the ſtrength of Men, upon which was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentented the Porch of the Temple of

                  <p>The Money needful to make all theſe Cloaths,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:106091:109"/>is taken out of the Revenues of the Lands which the ancient Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> have appointed for that purpoſe, which hath been confirmed by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours.

                  <p>That which was worthy of notice in this Pomp, was the blind Devotion of theſe Wretches for the things which are to be uſed by their Prophet, or employed in their Religion.

                  <p>ON the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> being <hi>Friday,</hi> S.
<hi>Matthias</hi>'s day, I went from <hi>Cairo</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Egypt,</hi> with an intention to viſit the Monaſtery of the <hi>Holy Martyrs</hi> at <hi>Iſne,</hi> and the other Antiquities that are about that City.</p>
                  <p>Beſides <hi>Idris</hi> my Man, I took along with me a
<hi>Moor,</hi> called <hi>Hagali,</hi> our near Neighbour, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me. We went aboard of a Bark that I had hired to carry us to <hi>Momfallot,</hi> for five and twenty <hi>Paras.</hi> The Viſiter of the Cuſtom-Houſe cauſed us to ſtop till the Evening; ſo that this night we only went round about the Iſle <hi>Roude,</hi> which is at a Musket-ſhot over againſt <hi>Old Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saturday</hi> the Rain fell betimes, and laſted till Noon; the Showers fell ſo furiouſly, that our Bark ſunk almoſt to the bottom: I wiſh'd then that ſuch as ſay that no Rain falls in <hi>Egypt</hi> had been there, for they would have ſeen the contrary. This Rain was ſucceeded by cold and tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Winds.</p>
                  <p>The next night there was another Rain fell as great as the former, which continued till three hours after the riſing of the Sun. As ſoon as it had diſſipated the Clouds, a good Wind, called
<hi>Teijab,</hi> or <hi>North-weſt,</hi> began to blow, and kept us company in all our Voyage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monday,</hi> very early, the 27th of the Month, we landed at
<hi>Beneſuef,</hi> a great Town ſcituated <pb n="214" facs="tcp:106091:111"/>upon the
<hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and tow hours after we went on board, to proceed on in our Voyage, leaving at our right hand, on the <hi>Weſt</hi> of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Feſohn,</hi> a great Town, about three or four hours travelling from <hi>Beneſuef,</hi> towards the <hi>South:</hi> At the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> we ſaw the Village <hi>Savadi Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dami,</hi> and about Sun-ſet we went by <hi>Heggiar Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lame,</hi> a dangerous Bank of
<hi>Nilus.</hi> At this place the Lands of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which are at the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> begin to be manured, for from
<hi>Cairo</hi> to this place, they are all cover'd with Sand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning, the 28th of <hi>February,</hi> we left at the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>Nilus</hi> two Caſtles ruinated, near one another, and paſs'd by the Mountain called <hi>Gebel-garanat,</hi> ſcituate on the ſame ſide, where the Territory of <hi>Egypt</hi> begins again to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful and ſandy.</p>
                  <p>A little before Noon we ſaw our ſelves over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Serarie,</hi> a Village on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> but within the Land, ſeated at the foot of this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. In this place our Bark ran in the Sand, and when the Boat-men were not able to free her, the
<hi>Janiſſaries</hi> that were with us forced all the other Travellers and Chriſtians with Cudgels to leap over into the water to help them.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as it was freed, we proceeded on in our way, and we began to diſcover the Caves of the Mountain which are at the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and a little after the Mount of Birds, called in
<hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick Gebel Teir,</hi> which is ſo equal from the top to the bottom about half a mile, that it looks like a ſtrait Wall, built by hand, rather than a Rock made thus by Nature, which is a very delightful ſight to Travellers. The water of <hi>Nilus</hi> waſhes a great deal of it: On the top of this Mountain <pb n="215" facs="tcp:106091:111"/>is the Monaſtery of the
<hi>Copties,</hi> called <hi>Deir il bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,</hi> and a little further ſeveral Caves, and the ruines if an Ancient Town.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tueſday</hi> night we were in ſight of <hi>Minie,</hi> but our Veſſel ran a-ground once more in the Banks of Sand, ſo that the Boat-men could not free it before night, and there it ſtopt till next day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in the morning, whiles our Boat-men were buſie in freeing the Boat, I went to ſee the City of <hi>Minie,</hi> ſcituate on the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> belonging to the
<hi>Caſcieflik</hi> of <hi>Behneſe.</hi> I went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo into the
<hi>Moſques</hi> without fear, becauſe I was cloathed in a
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Habit. When our Boat-men had freed the Bark, they drew her up to <hi>Minie,</hi> for we ſail'd upwards; there I went on board to go towards <hi>Melave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About an hours ſailing from <hi>Minie,</hi> we began to diſcover on the top of the Mountain, which lies at the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the Caves. This, in my judgment, is the beginning of the Country of
<hi>Thebes:</hi> They are to be ſeen along the Mountain, as far as
<hi>Momfallot;</hi> I counted four and thirty in a rank, but the Mouths of the Caves were ſtopped up with Earth that was fallen in.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day, about three a Clock in the Afternoon, we paſs'd by the Ruines of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient City <hi>Inſine,</hi> leaving it at our left hand, and at night we went to lie before <hi>Melave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſailed away on <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>March,</hi> and we ſaw in our way many Caves in the Mountain, which is at the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> At Noon we left the great Channel of <hi>Nilus,</hi> becauſe there was but little water, and we enter'd into one of its Branches, which makes an Iſland, by meeting again with the great Stream. We paſs'd
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:106091:112"/>before the Mouth of the River of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> of which I have ſpoken ſufficiently in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
<hi>Fium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friday</hi> morning, the third day of the month, we landed at <hi>Momfallot,</hi> where I lodged in an Houſe called <hi>Ocalet Emir Otman,</hi> or the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Prince Otman,</hi> which is in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. It is an old dwelling much decayed, and though there is another more beautiful, and more commodious, I would not lodge in it, that I might not ſuffer the affronts of the <hi>Jamſſaries</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hins,</hi> who lodg'd there, and who would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted over me, had they known me to be a
<hi>Franc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Momfallot,</hi> the abode of the <hi>Caſcief</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, is a very great and beautiful Town of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> ſcituate upon the banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> on the <hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide, in the middle
<hi>Egypt.</hi> There is made much Linen-cloth: A great many Chriſtian
<hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> live here, but they have no Church.</p>
                  <p>The name of this Town ſignifies in <hi>Arabick</hi> the
<hi>Exile of Lot,</hi> becauſe a certain <hi>Lot</hi> was baniſh'd thither by his Brother, an ancient King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> as the <hi>Copties</hi> ſay. Over againſt, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> are the ſigns of an ancient Town, I could never underſtand the name.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Cairo</hi> to <hi>Beneſuef</hi> there are two days journeys by Land; and by water, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs, according to the wind; from <hi>Beneſuef</hi> to <hi>Minie,</hi> are three days journeys by Land, from <hi>Minie</hi> to <hi>Melave</hi> is a little days journey, from <hi>Melave</hi> to <hi>Momfallot</hi> is a little more than a days journey, chiefly when the Horſe is not good; and from <hi>Momfallot</hi> one may go and dine at <hi>Siut,</hi> if one takes the morning.</p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:106091:112"/>
                  <p>In the Province of <hi>Momfallot</hi> they reckon one and fifty Towns, ſix and thirty at the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and fifteen at the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> which agrees not with the Relation of <hi>James Albert</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who reckons up two hundred and ſeventeen. In this he is miſtaken. Here are one and twenty Churches, or Monaſteries; eleven at the <hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> namely
<hi>Moharrak,</hi> with that of the <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> near by. The Church of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> at <hi>Buk:</hi> That of S. <hi>Theodore</hi> at

                  </p>
                  <p>There are twelve at the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of
<hi>Nilus,</hi> namely, the Church of S. <hi>Theodore,</hi> Martyr, S.

                  </p>
                  <p>The 7th day of this Month I went, about ſeven a Clock in the morning, for <hi>Siut,</hi> where I arrived about noon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Villages in the way; 1. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dara,</hi> where ſeveral Ruines remain, that beſpeak it to have been a great Town: 2.
<hi>Hantaca:</hi> 3. <hi>Gauli,</hi> where are to be ſeen ſome ancient

<hi>Coum Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehſein,</hi> where is to be ſeen the Tomb of one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Sciech Iſcander:</hi> 6. <hi>Mongabat</hi> that new, which is a very good Town, at the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and at the foot of the Mountain hard by old <hi>Mongabat,</hi> but now ruinated: At laſt we came to
<hi>Siut,</hi> which lies <hi>South-South-Eaſt</hi> from
<hi>Momfallot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I was arrived at <hi>Siut,</hi> I took two Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Houſe called <hi>Occalet il hammam,</hi> or <hi>the Bathing-houſe;</hi> ſo named, becauſe it is over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Publick Bathe; and though it be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it is pleaſant and commodious.</p>
                  <p>A few days after, I craved acquaintance with the Biſhop of the City, called <hi>Amba Joannes;</hi> he is a very honeſt Man, of a good life. He made me know a certain <hi>Coptie,</hi> named <hi>Muallim Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> the only Man of all the upper <hi>Egypt</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood his natural Tongue, that is, the <hi>Copties;</hi> but I could not benefit my ſelf much by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was deaf, and about fourſcore years of age: nevertheleſs I had the ſatisfaction to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that Man, with whom the <hi>Copties</hi> Language will be utterly loft.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Siut,</hi> called in <hi>Greek Lycopolis,</hi> is one of the moſt famous Towns of the Upper <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſcituate at the foot of a barren Mountain that ſtands on the <hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide, about half a league from <hi>Nilus.</hi> The Town is great and populous, full of Chriſtian
<hi>Copties,</hi> who may be about five hundred <hi>Caraches,</hi> or Maſters of Families that pay Tribute. They have there a Biſhop, and a poor Church dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="219" facs="tcp:106091:113"/>to the Abbot <hi>Der,</hi> whoſe Body, with that of his Siſter <hi>Erazi,</hi> a reputed Saint, with his Brother alſo, reſts at <hi>Emſciul,</hi> which is a Village belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Churches and Monaſteries of Chriſtian

<hi>Rife,</hi> a conſiderable Town at our right hand: next <hi>Muſcie,</hi> where the <hi>Copties</hi> had anciently a Church, dedicated to <hi>Mary Poctor Sciu,</hi> taking its name from the City of <hi>Sciu,</hi> which was next to
<hi>Abnub,</hi> but now ruinated. At three of the Clock in the Afternoon we arrived at <hi>Doveine,</hi> where we continued two days, becauſe the Biſhop of <hi>Sciut</hi> was to conſecrate there an Altar.</p>
                  <p>This Village owes its beginning to <hi>Tuh Bekerim,</hi> a Village near adjoining, whereof there appears not now the leaſt ſign: This is the cauſe.</p>

<hi>Copties</hi> wear. Out of the Town they have a Church, dedicated to
<hi>Amba Fam il Auſſimi,</hi> or to <hi>the Abbot Fam of Anſſim;</hi> but it is pitiful. There is in this Village a <hi>Caſcief.</hi>

                  <head>A Voyage to the <hi>White</hi> Monaſtery.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SAturday,</hi> the 18th of this Month, I went very early from <hi>Tahta,</hi> towards the famous Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of S. <hi>Sennodius,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>White,</hi> about a good days Journey from <hi>Tahta.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Siut</hi> gave me one of his <hi>Arabians,</hi> named
<hi>Havaras,</hi> to guide me.</p>
                  <p>At the going out of the Town I met with a kind of a
<hi>Janiſſary,</hi> called <hi>Seimen,</hi> who received no Sallary from the Grand Seignior, but lived by the orders of the <hi>Caſciefs;</hi> he was ſitting in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, where we were to paſs, his Muſquet upon his ſhoulder, a Cutlaſs at his ſide, and ready to march.</p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:106091:115"/>
                  <p>When we drew near him, he came to us, and ſtopt me bluntly, telling me that I muſt alight. I was much ſurpriſed with this affront, and vexed that without cauſe I was to loſe my Beaſt, I ſeem'd to be reſolved not to alight; we continued a pretty while to diſpute together, till I ſaw him lift up his Hatchet, which he wore at his Girdle, to cleave my head in two, and that my <hi>Arabian</hi> look'd idly upon us, as unconcern'd, I was forced to yield him my Aſs; upon which he got imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and rode away.</p>
                  <p>I returned to the Town, on foot, to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, who underſtanding my misfortune, cauſed another to be given me. I went on in my way, and at our going out of <hi>Tahta,</hi> we paſs'd by the Ruines of the ancient Town of <hi>Beneviet;</hi> we leſt at our left hand other ſigns of an ancient Town, called <hi>Poſone;</hi> from thence we paſs'd to
<hi>Sciendavil,</hi> a good Town, and at noon we got as far as
<hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zire,</hi> which is a Town where the <hi>Caſcief</hi> of the Province lives; when we had a little reſted our ſelves in a Coffee-houſe, we went on our way towards the Monaſtery, leaving the way of <hi>Sohaitg,</hi> which we had kept till then; we turned to the right hand, towards the Mountain which is on the <hi>Weſt</hi> of the Town, we went by <hi>Itfu,</hi> an ancient Town, called by the <hi>Copties</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; about noon we got to the Monaſtery, where we lodg'd at night.</p>
                  <p>The Monaſtery of S. <hi>Sennodius,</hi> the
<hi>Archiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drite,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>White,</hi> is built near the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the ancient Town <hi>Adribe.</hi> There are the Remains of one of the moſt Magnificent Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures that hath been in <hi>Egypt.</hi> It is fourſquare; its Walls are builded with hewn Stones, very
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106091:116"/>white; every Stone is four foot long, and a foot and three inches high. It is ſeven and thirty Perches and two foot long, which make two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty four foot, and eighteen Perches and three foot broad, which make one hundred and eleven foot. There be ſix great Gates of a red Stone, which now are walled up, one only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which now hath an open place as high as a Man. The chief Gate that is walled up is now called <hi>Bab il bagl,</hi> or <hi>the Mules Gate,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what happen'd to a Daughter of an Heathen King, who offered to go into the Church in contempt, riding upon a Mule, and was ſwallowed up alive in a Pit that opened, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh her inſolency; which Miracle happen'd by the Prayers of S.
<hi>Sennodius,</hi> who begg'd this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from God. This Gate is ten foot high, and ſix broad; every one of the Supporters is made up with four great Marble Stones, as well as the Lintil, upon which is graven three Croſſes, one great in the middle, and two little ones on the ſides.</p>
                  <p>Round about the Building are two ranks of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, the loweſt are in the middle, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers almoſt touch the top. The two longeſt ſides of the Building have each ſeven and twenty Windows in each Rank, and the ſhorter ſides each have nine in each rank, but all theſe Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are walled up.</p>
                  <p>The inſide of this Monaſtery is demolliſhed, the
<hi>Heikel</hi> excepted, where Maſs is ſaid, and the middle. The body of the Church, called by the <hi>Copties Giamelun,</hi> was heretofore ſupported with two ranks of Pillars, each having fourteen; which are yet ſtanding, but in the open Air; for the Vault is fallen down.</p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:106091:116"/>
                  <p>All the Pillars are not of the ſame Stone, nor Workmanſhip, nor bigneſs, nor height; for ſome are reaſonably big, others are ſlenderer. And to ſuch as are ſmall, they have clapt ſome Plaiſter, to make them as big as the others.</p>
                  <p>At the going in of the Chancel are to be ſeen two very beautiful Pillars of Marble, at the entry of the <hi>Heikel.</hi> Upon that which ſtands at the left hand is graven an Epitaph in <hi>Greek,</hi> of one named <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> Theſe Pillars are yet entire, and their Workmanſhip is very beautiful.</p>
                  <p>Almoſt every where in the Walls of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, in the Pavement that is before the Chancel, and in the great and beautiful pair of Stairs that lead up to the Sleeping-place of the Monks, are certain great Stones full of Cyphers and Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick Figures placed not right; by which we may underſtand, that thoſe that have put them there had no knowledge of this myſterious Tongue. In the Walls within are ſix holes in each ſide, vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, and curiouſly adorned with carved Leaves, ſo handſomly wrought that I could not ſufficiently admire the Workmanſhip. Round about the Monaſtery there is much black Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>In one of the Apartments of the Monaſtery, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> at the left hand as one goes in, there is a large and deep Well. The Monks told me that the Water was forty Cubits deep, and that it had been ſanctified, or bleſs'd, by our Saviour. It is very ſweet and wholeſome, and riſes and falls with <hi>Nilus,</hi> though it hath no communication with this River.</p>
                  <p>The next day in the morning, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> and the ninth day of the Month, after Maſs, I went, <pb n="226" facs="tcp:106091:117"/>with my
<hi>Arabian,</hi> towards <hi>Red</hi> Monaſtery, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hours travelling from the <hi>White,</hi> at the foot of the ſame Mountain, towards
<hi>Tahta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The colour of the Bricks with which this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery is built, hath given it the name of <hi>Red.</hi> It is built in the ſame manner as the
<hi>White,</hi> but a great deal leſs. At the <hi>South</hi>-ſide it hath yet a Building ſtanding, that was creſted, as the Monks ſay, by S.
<hi>Helene,</hi> when ſhe went to <hi>Iſne</hi> to viſit the bodies of the holy Martyrs. It was intended to incloſe the Well of the Monaſtery within the Walls, and to hinder the <hi>Arabians,</hi> when they made in roads from their Mountains, from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Monks, or taking away from them the Water.</p>
                  <p>There remains nothing of this Church, but the Chancel, and the
<hi>Heikel,</hi> or place where Maſs is read. The Pillars that kept up the body of the Church are yet ſtanding, all of an equal length and bigneſs. In this particular they excell thoſe of the <hi>White</hi> Monaſtery, as well as in the beauty of the Workmanſhip, eſpecially their Capitals.</p>
                  <p>The Builders of this Monaſtery was <hi>Amba Biſcioi,</hi> who having a long time liv'd as a Robber, as the Story of his Life ſaith, at laſt he repented and ended his days very well. Some told me, that the Club with which he us'd to knock down Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers is hung up in the Chancel of this Church. I ſaw it not, becauſe I was told of it after I was gone out of the Monaſtery.</p>
                  <p>There is a Pillar alſo at each ſide of the Door of the
<hi>Heikel,</hi> of an excellent Workmanſhip, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their Capitals, which are the moſt beautiful that I ever beheld.</p>
                  <p>But this Monaſtery, as well as the <hi>White,</hi> is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ruinated within.</p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:106091:117"/>
                  <p>When I had ſeen all that was worthy of notice, I return'd to
<hi>Tahta,</hi> where I arriv'd, about noon, the 21th of the month, and the next day we went to <hi>Siut.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A few days after, I went with the Biſhop of <hi>Siut</hi> to the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three hours travelling from thence, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied to ſee there ſome rare Reliques of Antiquity, but I was deceiv'd; for I ſaw that it was one of the moſt woful Monaſteries in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo that I ſhall not mention it any more.</p>
                  <p>In our way to this Monaſtery, we ſaw that of the Virgin at
<hi>Doronque,</hi> ſcituate upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſtands at the right hand.</p>
                  <p>This Monaſtery, with its Church, are cut in the Rock; which is the only thing there to be noted. All the reſt was ſo far from ſatisfying my Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I beheld nothing but Ruines and miſery.</p>
                  <p>But that I might not loſe, altogether, my labour, in climbing up to the Mountain, I went to ſee the Caves that were near. My Guide led me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one as high as a Man on horſeback, ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary large, that without hyperbole a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe might there draw up in Battel array, which cauſed me to wonder not a little.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as we were out of this large Cave, my Guide led me into another hard by, larger than the former: when I was within about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces, he told me to hearken to a certain place of the Wall, at the left hand as one goes in. Uſe no doubt had made him take notice of this place; for I ſaw no ſign outward to cauſe one to mind it. I drew near to liſten, and I heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Wall, the noiſe as of a Wind-mill, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct that I marvelled greatly, only the noiſe <pb n="228" facs="tcp:106091:118"/>ſeem'd to come from far. I wonder'd the more, when he told me that behind this Rock there was no empty place, nor paſſage, for the Air to make this noiſe, which has continued during the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Man. All Perſons of whom I inquir'd for the cauſe of this Wonder, told me nothing elſe, but that it was a <hi>Taliſman,</hi> and that there was ſome hidden Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>A little further, towards the <hi>South,</hi> upon the ſame Mountain, are to be ſeen the Ruines of an ancient Monaſtery, dedicated to S. <hi>Severus,</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> whom the <hi>Copties</hi> reverence as a Saint, becauſe he maintain'd the Doctrine of
<hi>Dioſcorus</hi> their Patriarch, whoſe opinions they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The Biſhop of <hi>Siut</hi> told me, that heretofore three hundred and threeſcore Monks inhabited in this Monaſtery, who employed themſelves in ſeeking for the Philoſopher Stone, and in the works of Chymiſtry; an excellent Employment for ſuch as have left the World, and forſaken their Riches.</p>

                  <p>THE 26th of <hi>March</hi> I return'd to <hi>Momfallot,</hi> with an intent to take Boat for <hi>Girge,</hi> and continue my Travels farther. I enter'd into the Town about noon; as ſoon as I was in my former Lodging, a Man of my acquaintance gave me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the Chriſtians of that place, thoſe very Perſons to whom I had been recommended by their Patriarch, had accuſed me to the <hi>Caſcief,</hi> and told him that I was a rich <hi>Franc,</hi> who made it my buſineſs to run up and down the Land, to diſcover <pb n="229" facs="tcp:106091:118"/>where the Treaſures were hid, to inform the King of <hi>France,</hi> who intended to come and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Egypt.</hi> This Friend ſaid alſo that the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cief</hi> had commanded to take me, where ever I ſhould be found.</p>
                  <p>This wicked news made me think upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and at that time there was no conveniency to go by Water to <hi>Girge,</hi> and becauſe the
<hi>Caſcief</hi> might have ſooner taken me on that ſide, his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction reaching a great way; I went back to <hi>Melave,</hi> becauſe his Dominion was but narrow thitherward. I took that way to return to
<hi>Cairo,</hi> the place of my ordinary abode, whither I went by Land; for I had been by Water before.</p>
                  <p>At our going out of <hi>Momfallot</hi> we went by <hi>Om il Coſſur,</hi> a Village, where great Mountains of Ruines are to he ſeen. We left next at our left hand, the ſigns of the ancient Town
<hi>Coſſie,</hi> which is called by the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors
<hi>Apollonopolis.</hi> We went by <hi>Sennabo</hi> next, which is a very good and populous Town. We ſaw <hi>Biblau, Bamib,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sun ſet we came to <hi>Tarut Iſſcerif,</hi> a great Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, where we were entertained <hi>gratis</hi> by an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian</hi> Lord, who keeps an Houſe of Hoſpitality, called in that Tongue <hi>Beit diafe,</hi> to lodge Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that will ſtay there a night, with their Beaſts. He entertains them at his own charge.</p>
                  <p>The next day, the 28th of the Month, after that I had returned thanks to my Benefactor, I went ſtreight to <hi>Melave.</hi> At our going out of <hi>Tarut Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerif,</hi> I went through the Channel of
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on foot, for there it begins. I went next to
<hi>Tanuf,</hi> a Village, where ſome Ruines are yet to be ſeen; and about noon we were at <hi>Melave,</hi> where I lodged at the <hi>Occale,</hi> or Inn, that is near the <pb n="230" facs="tcp:106091:119"/>Market-place, at the
<hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of the Town, near the great <hi>Moſque;</hi> and becauſe the upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were all taken up by <hi>Turks,</hi> I was obliged to lodge in a very low Room, where I met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconveniences, becauſe it was near the Door, at the paſſage of all comers and goers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the 29th of the Month, the <hi>Turks</hi> begin the Feaſt called <hi>Eid il dehie,</hi> or <hi>the Eaſter of the Victims;</hi> for they uſe to kill Sheep during this Feſtival, and give the Fleſh to the Poor for Gods ſake. This Feſtival continues three days, during which time the <hi>Copties</hi> buy no Victuals from the
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> nor Bread, Wine, Fleſh, Coffee, nor Water. By this they diſcover their abhorrency of that Religion; for thereby they ſhun all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of communicating with them.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Melave</hi> I got acquaintance with an Arch-Prieſt of that place, called <hi>Naſſr alla.</hi> He was the honeſteſt, civileſt, and ableſt Man that I ever knew of that Nation.

                  <p>I Was loth to return to <hi>Cairo</hi> without ſeeing the Country of the Lower <hi>Thebes,</hi> or at leaſt a part of it, ſeeing that I was ſo near it; I reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore to follow the advice of my Friend,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106091:119"/>the Arch-Prieſt, and to go to the Monaſtery of
<hi>Abuhennis il Keſſir,</hi> or of S. <hi>John</hi> the little, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was Governour, ſcituate near the ancient Town <hi>Inſine,</hi> on the
<hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> about an hours travelling from
<hi>Melave,</hi> to ſee the Rarities thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saturday,</hi> the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> I went from
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lave</hi> to this Monaſtery; and the next day, being our
<hi>Eaſter-Sunday,</hi> I got a Guide to lead me upon the Mountain, which is behind, on the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide, to ſee the Caves of the ancient Hermites that are round about, and near to the Town, which have given to it the name of <hi>Thebes,</hi> as we ſhall ſee in the following diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>I went into many of theſe Caves that were all very large. I ſaw nothing worthy of notice, but in ſome certain Croſſes graven in the Rock; and upon the Walls of one I ſaw two Angels, holding up with their hands a Croſs in the Air.</p>
                  <p>The only thing that pleas'd me among theſe Caves, was a Monaſtery, with a Church, all cut in a firm Rock. The Vault of the Church was ſmooth, and the Paving very even. The Walls were painted in an antick faſhion, with the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the New Teſtament, with Images of Hermites, and Saints, whoſe names were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten underneath in
<hi>Coptick</hi> Letters. At the end of the Church, <hi>Southward,</hi> I ſaw a Croſs cut in the Rock, with a <hi>Greek</hi> Inſcription, in ancient Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. And upon the Walls of another Cave, at a little diſtance from this Church, and higher, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the top of the Mountain, I ſound alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graven upon the Wall; and near this, two others, which are all Epitaphs of Abbots there Interr'd. I could not cauſe them to be put here,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106091:120"/>becauſe the Printer would not be at the charge of the Characters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> the third, being <hi>Monday</hi> in
<hi>Eaſter</hi> Week, I went to the ancient Town of <hi>Inſine,</hi> called in the <hi>Copties</hi> Dictionaries <hi>Antinoe,</hi> and <hi>Thebes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went to ſee firſt the Tomb of <hi>Mahomet Bey,</hi> a
<hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Girge,</hi> about fourteen years ago. When he took arms againſt <hi>Pacha Gaze,</hi> he was defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Melave,</hi> and his men forſook him; he was taken and ſtrangled. His Tomb is out of the City in the common burying place, and though there is nothing there extraordinary, I was deſirous to ſee it, becauſe he hath been, and is yet in great reputation amongſt the Inhabitants for his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and good Government, which hath cauſed him to be lamented by all the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I had ſeen this Tomb, I walked into the Town, and the firſt thing that I took notice of, as a great Antiquity, was the Pillar of
<hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> Its bottom is above five foot, the four uppermoſt are all even, and the fifth below is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with carved leaves. In the Baſis is a <hi>Greek</hi> Inſcription containing thirteen lines.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw near this Pillar the pieces of three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, very much reſembling this, but broken down; there was nothing of them ſtanding but the Baſis of one.</p>
                  <p>From the Pillar I went to ſee the <hi>Arch of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,</hi> which is almoſt all ſtanding. I took a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to climb up to it by a little pair of Stairs winding up in the Wall of the Arch, containing fifty ſteps, or thereabouts. I reſted my ſelf at the greateſt Window which is upon the chief Vault, where I had the ſatisfaction to diſcover all its ruines, and the ſcituation of this Town, heretofore ſo famous.</p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:106091:120"/>
                  <p>This Arch is alone, and altogether ſeparated from the other Ruines, and about four paces from the River <hi>Nilus;</hi> but for want of an Inſcription, none knows for whom, and by whom it hath been rais'd. It is not inrich'd with carved Works, as thoſe of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> nevertheleſs it is one of the moſt beautiful that I have ever ſeen.</p>
                  <p>One of its fronts hath eight and forty foot in breadth, and one of its ſides four and twenty. The great Vault in the middle, which is between two little ones, is about 16 foot broad, and each of the two little ones ſeven foot. The thickneſs of the Wall which is between the great and the little Vaults, which is but one ſtone, is of ſix foot and two inches: The thickneſs which is between the little Vault, and the outward Angle of the Arch, is of five foot: The front that looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Nilus,</hi> is on the
<hi>South-Eaſt</hi> ſide.</p>
                  <p>There is yet fourteen Pillars of Marble on the left hand of this Arch, in a ſtreight line towards the River; ſome of them have their Capitals, others have loſt them; ſome are joyned to the Huts of ſome
<hi>Arabians</hi> that dwell there. On the ſame ſide, towards the Monaſtery of <hi>Abuhennis,</hi> are to be ſeen three beautiful Pillars of
<hi>Porphyry</hi> ſtanding; ſome of them have their tops; a fourth lies along the ground near by.</p>
                  <p>In the Moſque of this Town is a <hi>Sciech,</hi> or
<hi>Saint,</hi> whom the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Sciech Abade,</hi> for whom they have a great Veneration, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to have been a
<hi>Mahometan;</hi> but they are much deceived, he was a Chriſtian, a Biſhop of <hi>Iſne,</hi> he ſuffered Martyrdom at <hi>Iſne.</hi> They have called him <hi>Sciech Abade,</hi> by an error which the Sir-name of this Biſhop hath cauſed. He was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <pb n="234" facs="tcp:106091:121"/>
                     <hi>Ammonius il Abed,</hi> or <hi>the devout Ammonius.</hi> The <hi>Arabians,</hi> through a miſtake of the word <hi>Abed,</hi> making it a proper name, whereas it is but an appellative, have called him <hi>Sciech Abade.</hi> His Reliques are kept in the <hi>Heikel</hi> of this Church, which now is a Moſque.</p>
                  <p>I went afterwards to take a view of a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Palace, called by the <hi>Arabians Abulkerun,</hi> or the <hi>horned Building,</hi> becauſe, as I think, the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that are before this Palace have Capitals, whereof the Angles are ſo great, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as ſo many Horns to the beholders, which the word <hi>Kern</hi> ſignifies. But when I had viewed ſo many old Reliques, I was ſo weary, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Monaſtery; and the rather, becauſe of the violent heat, with an intent to return ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, and examine all things more exactly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tueſday</hi> the fourth of <hi>April,</hi> I went with my ordinary Guide to ſee the <hi>Vadigamus,</hi> and the Caves that are there.
<hi>Vadigamus</hi> is a narrow Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, between two Mountains, which are as high as one another, and flat on the top. This Valley is like a Bugle, from whence I believe this Valley hath borrowed the name; for the word
<hi>Vadiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> ſignifies the Valley of the Bugle. At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it hath a large entrance, which anſwers to a great ſandy Plain, which is at one ſide of the Monaſtery of <hi>Abuhennis.</hi> It ſtretches it ſelf
<hi>Southwards,</hi> about half an hours travelling over: Afterwards it riſeth by degrees to the top of the Mountains, where it unites and joyns them, and repreſents the bottom of a Sack.</p>
                  <p>On both ſides of theſe two Mountains that face one another, are two Ranks of Caves, each Rank containing fifty Caves, or thereabouts,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106091:121"/>which make one hundred Caves upon each Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I enter'd into ſome of them that were ſo high, that three long Pikes tyed to one another would not have reach'd to the top: They are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, but without order within, and uneven, and not perfectly ſquare.</p>
                  <p>I have wondered at the capricious deſigns of the Ancient
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> to make ſuch wide Caves ſo high, and ſo numerous, yielding ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to the Inhabitants, for they are made upon the ſteep Mountains of Sand, far from Towns and Water, digg'd in the dark and main Rocks. If I had not perus'd the Hiſtory of <hi>Said ibn Patrik,</hi> who ſaith, that the <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s, Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> imployed the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> in digging in theſe Mountains, I ſhould be of the opinion of the Country people, who believe that all theſe Caves have been made by Devils, who have been thereunto forced by Conjurers, this Art having been always much practis'd in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for one would think that it is not poſſible for men to make them: and I dare ſay, that when a Traveller hath ſeen all the Curioſities of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if he hath not ſeen theſe Mountains and Caves of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Thebes,</hi> he hath ſeen nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the fifth of the Month, I went again to
<hi>Inſine,</hi> to look upon its Ruines with more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, and chiefly upon the Pillars that ſtand before the <hi>Abulkerun,</hi> on the
<hi>North-weſt</hi> ſide.</p>
                  <p>There are in all four before the front of this Palace, which heretofore was very magnificent, but now there remains but little, incompaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the Ruines. Two of theſe Pillars are on the one ſide of the door, and two on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; three are yet ſtanding, only a third part of <pb n="236" facs="tcp:106091:122"/>the fourth appears: they are made of a certain white ſandy ſtone, which is taken out of the Mountains near this Town: they are hollow on the ſides, from the bottom to the middle, but the reſt upwards is ſmooth: the bottom or bulk is nigh thirteen foot about; their Capitals are of two pieces, ſeven foot in Diameter; every bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is of five pieces, and every piece is ſeven foot long.</p>
                  <p>There was behind this Palace, on the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> ſide, four other Pillars of the ſame bigneſs, form, and ſubſtance; but they are overthrown. I could ſcarce diſcern where their Baſis ſtood: the Pillar of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſtands at the
<hi>North-Weſt</hi> ſide of this old Palace.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day I went again to ſee the Pillar of <hi>Marcus Aurelius;</hi> its Baſis is thirteen foot high, made up with eight ranks of ſtones; the firſt and loweſt is half in the ground, and half out; the ſecond is two foot high; the third a foot and eight inches; the fourth, fifth, and ſixth, upon which is the Inſcription, each two foot and two inches; the ſeventh bends out; the eighth is the immediate Baſis upon which the Pillar ſtands: This Baſis is five foot long, and two foot and ten inches high; it is ſquare in the bottom, in the middle Octogone, or of eight Angles, and in the top Oval: upon this ſtone is the bottom of the Pillar, which is made up of five pieces; the lowermoſt is beautified with Oaken leaves car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſtone; I have never ſeen the like elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, it is three foot and a half high; the four other pieces are of ſeven foot each, and three inches long; the Diameter of the Pillar is of three foot and ſeven inches; the Capital is of <pb n="237" facs="tcp:106091:122"/>one ſtone, three foot and an inch high; the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference is of ſeven foot; upon the Capital ſtands an unpoliſh'd ſtone, four foot and two inches long, and three foot high.</p>
                  <p>I perceived that in this Town heretofore there hath been two Streets more remarkable than the others; one begun at the <hi>Abulkerun,</hi> and ended at the four Pillars of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> ſtretching from
<hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>North.</hi> This Street was adorned with two ranks of Pillars, one rank in each ſide: the ſecond begins at the Arch of Triumph, which is at one end of the Town, at the <hi>South-Eaſt,</hi> drawing to the
<hi>North-Eaſt.</hi> Theſe Streets are very long, large, ſtreight, and full of ruines of ſtately Palaces.</p>
                  <p>About three a Clock in the Afternoon, I went the third time to ſee the Monaſtery digg'd in the Rock, mentioned before. I have always taken a great delight to view it, becauſe the ſight of it moved my Devotion: It ſtands about half an hours travelling a-foot from the Monaſtery of
<hi>Abuhennis,</hi> where I was, and <hi>Eaſt</hi> from this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Inſine,</hi> as well as in the Caves of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains round about, are to be ſeen in the ground great Pots, in which the ancient Inhabitants of this Province kept their Wines: They have an Ear at each ſide, and are ſharp at the bottom, that they might be ſixed in the ground: my Guide found many, which he brought to me; but the Wine was dried within, and as black as Pitch: I have ſent two of them to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeventh of <hi>April,</hi> the <hi>Good-Friday</hi> of the
<hi>Copties,</hi> I went with my Guide to ſee the Caves that are near the Monaſtery of <hi>Amba Biſcioi,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <pb n="238" facs="tcp:106091:123"/>a mile from the Convent, towards the <hi>South.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt remarkable thing that I ſaw, was the Hieroglyphick Cave, which the Country people commonly call the Church. I conceive this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake proceeds from the Croſſes which are paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where within.</p>
                  <p>To go into this Cave, one muſt paſs through another before it. This was heretofore very beautiful and great, but now it is much decayed. The top is fallen down; there remains nothing but the two ſide-walls, full of Hieroglyphick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures graven in the Rock; ſome are great, others are little, others are of a moderate ſize, but all very clean in good order.</p>
                  <p>From thence is a paſſage into the Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Cave, which I believe was a Temple of the Heathens: It is ſquare, very ſmooth within, cut in the Rock, ſour Perches long, three Perches and one foot broad, and two Perches high: The door that leads into it is four foot and a half large. In this Cave, over againſt the door, is a hole in the Wall, of a Perch and a foot deep, and four foot broad, and a Perch and one foot and eight inches high. This Cave is full of Images in the Walls, and above, which repreſent their Sciences by Emblemes, and Hieroglyphick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, with very little Characters in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage round about. The colours of them are ſo beautiful and lively, that I could not but wonder how they could continue ſo freſh, during ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this great number of Characters there painted, are to be ſeen ſome lines of the ſame little Characters very clean carved in the Wall, <pb n="239" facs="tcp:106091:123"/>ſome reaching from one end to the other, others from the top to the bottom. Theſe Characters, and Figures, are ſo numerous, that they are not to be drawn by any in leſs than a Months time.</p>
                  <p>Under theſe two Caves there is a rank of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Rock, very even within, but they are without Figures, and leſs, and not ſo high as the former; for they are but ſix foot high. In the bottom of every Cave is a Well, ſquare, and deep in the Rock, into which one may go down by the means of holes, or ſteps, made on purpoſe in both ſides of every Well. And in the bottom of every Well is an Alley in the Rock, but becauſe theſe Alleys are durty and obſcure, none of our Company would venture to go down. In the Walls of ſome of theſe Caves are ſquare holes, ſix foot deep, and two foot broad, about the bigneſs of a Coffin; which makes me believe that the
<hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> did put here their dead in theſe Caves.</p>
                  <p>A little farther, towards the <hi>South,</hi> is another large Cave. I ſaw on the left hand an Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Picture in the Wall, with thirteen lines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, of Characters cut in the Picture.</p>
                  <p>From this Cave, which is at the end of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, towards the <hi>South,</hi> we went back to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of <hi>Abuhennis;</hi> and in our way we ſaw all the Caves that are in order upon this Mountain, as far as the place where the <hi>Vadigamus</hi> begins. We ſaw no rarity, only ſome painted Croſſes, in red, roughly drawn; from whence we gathered, that heretofore they have ſerved as Churches.</p>
                  <p>By the differing Workmanſhip of theſe Caves, one may eaſily diſtinguiſh ſuch as have been made by the ancient
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> by the Chriſtians, and Anchorites that cauſed this Province to flouriſh; <pb n="240" facs="tcp:106091:124"/>for the former are very regular, out within, with much care, and ſmooth; but the others are rough, and irregular.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Country People think that there is no Cave without a rich Treaſure, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> have digg'd every where, and ſpoil'd alſo the Hieroglyphick Cave, which is named the Church. They have ſo much undermin'd the Walls that ſome of the top is fallen down, and the Rain hath ſpoiled ſome of the Emblems, and Characters that adorned the Wall. And, as if Time had not blotted out enough, they have put out the Eyes of the Images, and Figures, in a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh manner, natural to them. I was highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd to ſee this; for were it not for this bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, this beautiful Cave would have kept it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> entire till now.</p>
                  <p>When we had ſtaid nine days in the Monaſtery of
<hi>Abuhennis,</hi> I return'd to <hi>Melave,</hi> the 8th of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril;</hi> from whence I went, the 15th of the ſame Month, to <hi>Minie,</hi> altering my firſt deſign to go by Land; for I ſaw that it would be too painful, and too dangerous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Minie,</hi> in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Books called <hi>Miniet ibn chaſſit,</hi> is an ancient, great, and beautiful Town, on the
<hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus.</hi> Its Antiquity appears by its old Buildings, by its ſtrait Streets, ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that two Men can ſcarce to a-breaſt. In this Town the <hi>Bardaques,</hi> or Water-pots, are made, which are highly eſteem'd at <hi>Cairo,</hi> for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and property, to cool Water. They are made with a kind of Clay, taken about a days Journey from thence, on the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> in a place called
<hi>Sciech fadl,</hi> from the name of a religious <hi>Mahometan</hi> there Interr'd.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:106091:124"/>
                  <p>The 19th of this Month, I went aboard a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, bound for
<hi>Beneſuef;</hi> a good Wind carried us a great way in a little ſpace of time. At nine a Clock we were over againſt <hi>Gebel Teir,</hi> or <hi>the Mountain of Birds;</hi> ſo called, becauſe at a ſet day of the year, all the Birds round about meet in a place, where a <hi>Taliſman</hi> draws them together from all ſides, and cauſeth them to ſtay there one day; when they have continued there till night, they all fly away, one excepted, which remains there, the Bill fixed in the Rock, till the ſame day the next year; at which time it falls down, and another takes its place.</p>
                  <p>When we paſs'd over againſt this Mountain, I ſaw on the top a Stone, which is called the Camel, becauſe, at a diſtance, it is like a Camel. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further in our way, we diſcover'd <hi>Taka,</hi> or the Window, or a great hole which Nature hath made in the Rock, like a Window; which ſerves as a paſſage for the Birds when they go to their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous whither the <hi>Taliſman</hi> draws them, as the People of the Country ſay, and their Hiſtorians affirm.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Moors</hi> are come to this Window, they uſe to ſay the Chapter of the <hi>Fatha,</hi> or firſt Chapter of the
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> for the poor People, who live, as they ſay, in this part of the Mountain, as Beaſts, feeding upon nothing but raw Herbs. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner we went by <hi>Bene Mohammed il Kifur,</hi> a Village ſcituate on the
<hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt it is an old Monaſtery, ruinated; and a little further appear a great many Caves, upon the Mountain near by. After we had paſs'd by an old Caſtle deſtroyed, we went to lye at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemzar,</hi> a great Village, ſcituate on the
<hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide <pb n="242" facs="tcp:106091:125"/>of <hi>Nilus,</hi> this River having waſh'd away almoſt half the Buildings.</p>
                  <p>We went from thence, <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning, the 20th of
<hi>April,</hi> with a <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> Wind, fit to carry us to
<hi>Beneſuef.</hi> It was yet in the morning when we ſailed before
<hi>Heggiar Selame,</hi> which is a Bank in the River <hi>Nilus.</hi> Over againſt it are the Ruines of an ancient Town, and the Tomb of a
<hi>Sciech,</hi> or Saint. About noon we were near the Ruines of another ancient Town, called <hi>Medinet Giahel,</hi> which ſtands at the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>Nilus;</hi> there are to be ſeen yet ſeveral Remains of Houſes, made up with Bricks dried in the Sun. Over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it is
<hi>Feggen,</hi> a Village often mention'd in a Book called <hi>Sinaxar.</hi> After Dinner a ſtrong Wind aroſe, and forced us to ſtop at <hi>Bebe,</hi> a great Village which is near <hi>Beneſuef,</hi> where we found incamped a Troop of <hi>Arabians,</hi> called <hi>Ateijat,</hi> with whom I paſs'd the reſt of the day in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friday,</hi> the 21th of the Month, we arriv'd at

                  <p>But that the Reader may know what rarities are to be ſeen in this Town, and round about, I have here added that which hath been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by Father <hi>Portais,</hi> a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> in the year 1668. according to the account given me by the Reverend Father <hi>Francis,</hi> his Brother, and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in his Travels.

<hi>Copties</hi> have Churches, that of <hi>Iſne</hi> is the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from
<hi>Cairo.</hi> It is built at the <hi>Weſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> upon a Hill that ſtretches along the River. It may be judged to be an ancient Town, by a Temple of Pagans yet ſtanding. The <hi>Copties</hi> have there two Churches, but very poor; one is dedicated to the bleſſed Virgin, and the other to S. <hi>Pelagius.</hi> The Chriſtian <hi>Copties</hi> here may make twenty <hi>Caraches</hi> in number; they are all Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ruled by two Arch-Prieſts, the one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the other
<hi>Soliman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Half a mile from <hi>Iſne</hi> is to be ſeen a Convent, which the <hi>Copties</hi> ſay hath been built by S. <hi>Helena,</hi> dedicated to the holy Martyrs of this Town, whom the Governour of
<hi>Diocleſian</hi> Maſſacred in ſuch numbers, that their dead Corpſes cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fourſcore <hi>Fiddans,</hi> or Acres of Ground. Round about this Burying-place are to be ſeen Tombs curiouſly wrought, which they ſay were erected by this holy Empreſs.</p>
                  <p>Three leagues from <hi>Iſne</hi> is another Convent, dedicated to S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where are four or five Tombs, like thoſe that we come from mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Upon an Altar Stone of a little Chappel, dedicated to St.
<hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, we ſound ſome Characters which were not Hyero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick, in a Language that we underſtood not.</p>
                  <p>About eleven leagues on this ſide of <hi>Iſne,</hi> at the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> is to be ſeen <hi>Tuot,</hi> a great Town, where is a Temple of the ancient <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Twelve leagues from <hi>Tuot,</hi> at the <hi>Weſt</hi> of
<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> is <hi>Arment,</hi> heretofore a great Town, but now forſaken and ruinated. They call it in <hi>Arabick Beled Muſe,</hi> or
<hi>the Country of Moſes,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> believe that
<hi>Moſes</hi> was born here. <pb n="244" facs="tcp:106091:126"/>Here is under ground an ancient Temple.</p>
                  <p>Two leagues on this ſide of <hi>Tuot,</hi> are two Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages very famous; namely, <hi>Luxor,</hi> and <hi>Luxor il Kadim,</hi> or <hi>the old Luxor;</hi> they are about half a league from one another.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Luxor</hi> is to be ſeen the Remains of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and beautiful Temple of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in which are threeſcore and eighteen Pillars of a prodigious bigneſs, chiefly fourteen, placed in rank, two and two; ſo big that ſix Men can ſcarce embrace them, but they are but ſix Perches high.</p>
                  <p>The bottom of this Temple is yet entire; here are ſeveral Chambers, and ſeparations, whereof the Walls are full, from the top to the bottom, of Figures roughly drawn, and Hieroglyphick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters carved over. Before the Door ſtands two Needles, ſquare, and very high and entire; ſo freſh that one would think that the Workman hath newly finiſh'd them. They are on every ſide eight foot broad.</p>
                  <p>Near their Baſis are two Statues of Women, of black Marble; and though they be half under ground, to the Girdle, they ſtand out as high as three Men.</p>
                  <p>Their bigneſs is anſwerable to their height; for there is twelve foot from one ſhoulder to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They have a ſtrange kind of covering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, with a Globe on the top. Their Faces are disfigur'd, the reſt is whole.</p>
                  <p>The deſcription of the Frontiſpiece of this Temple, is with the other Pictures.</p>
                  <p>At the old <hi>Luxor</hi> is a very ancient Palace. Its Ruines ſhew that it hath been very glorious. They ſay, that here dwelt one of the ancient Kings of <hi>Egypt.</hi> In the Walks of this Palace are to be ſeen
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106091:126"/>many <hi>Sphinxes,</hi> in ranks, on both ſides of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, two foot from one another, looking upon the Alley. They have every one, one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foot in length. This Palace hath four Walks, that anſwer to four Gates. In the firſt are one hundred and twenty <hi>Sphinxes,</hi> threeſcore in each ſide; and in the ſecond are one hundred and two, one and fifty in aſide. Every Walk is about the length of a place to play at
<hi>Mall.</hi> the Gates of the Palace are extraordinary high, made with the moſt beautiful Stones in the World; one of the ſides of the Gate is ſix and twenty foot high. (I find in another Copy of this Relation, that it hath thirty ſix foot.) The Palace is ſo defaced, that there is no order, nor beauty, that appears; nevertheleſs there are ſo many curious things in it, that no Man in a Month, can take a full view of them; for there is above a Million of Figures, roughly drawn; ſome are covered over, others appear with an open face. Here are alſo a great many Pillars; I counted, ſaith the Father, in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour threeſcore, which are all ſo great, that five Men can ſcarce embrace one of them about.</p>
                  <p>In the Court of the Palace is a Baſon garniſhed about with beautiful Stones, and full of a bitter VVater, which, as the People ſay, whitens Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen very well. I tried it, ſaith the Father, by dipping into it my Handkerchief, which kept above four days the ſmell of Soap. At one Front of the Palace are two Statues of a Giant, of one Stone, as white as Alabaſter. They have Swords by their ſides. In the middle of the Palace is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as high as three Men, not well polliſh'd, but well proportioned.</p>
                  <p>A league on this ſide there is an ancient Town,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106091:127"/>called <hi>Habu,</hi> where are to be ſeen many rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, chiefly <hi>Mommies.</hi> At a diſtance one may there diſcover two Statues; one of a Man, the other of a VVoman. The Country People call that
<hi>Sciama,</hi> and this <hi>Tama,</hi> They ſeem to be at leaſt as big as the <hi>Abulhon,</hi> or the <hi>Sphinx</hi> over againſt <hi>Cairo.</hi> Near this place is a Village, where is to be ſeen two Statues from the River
<hi>Nilus,</hi> ſo new that one would think the Workman had juſt perfected them.</p>
                  <p>Thirteen leagues on this ſide of the old <hi>Luxor,</hi> is a Town named <hi>Neggade,</hi> where is a Biſhop with about ſeventy Families of Chriſtian <hi>Copties.</hi> Here is yet three Monaſteries, one is called
<hi>Deir il Salib,</hi> or <hi>the Monaſtery of the holy Croſs;</hi> the ſecond <hi>Deir il Megma;</hi> the third <hi>Deir Mary Poctor;</hi> but theſe two laſt are not inhabited.</p>
                  <p>Two miles from <hi>Neggade,</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> is the ancient Town of <hi>Kus;</hi> but here are but threeſcore Chriſtian <hi>Copties,</hi> who have here a Church, dedicated to S. <hi>Stephen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Six leagues from <hi>Neggade,</hi> on this ſide, is
<hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> a Village ſcituate on the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Bank of
<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> It is a Mart-Town, and the Rendezvous of the <hi>Caravans</hi> that go from <hi>Cairo</hi> to <hi>Coſſeir,</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named
<hi>Berenice,</hi> four days Journies from this Village, and a Haven of the
<hi>Red-Sea.</hi> The Chriſtians that live at <hi>Kenne</hi> are very poor, and without any Church.</p>
                  <p>Two leagues on this ſide of <hi>Kenne</hi> is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Town of <hi>Tentiris,</hi> now called <hi>Dendera,</hi> where is a wonderful Temple of the ancient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of a prodigious bigneſs and height. It is to be ſeen at two leagues diſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Macrizi</hi> ſaith, that it hath as many Windows
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106091:127"/>as there are days in the year: They are ſo plac'd, that every one anſwers to a degree of the <hi>Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack;</hi> ſo that the Sun riſing in a differing degree every day of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> it ſends in its Beams into a diſtinct Window from the day before: And when at the end of the year it hath finiſh'd and run through every degree of the
<hi>Zodiack,</hi> it hath alſo from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> caſt in its Beams into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Window of this Temple: For this cauſe it is look'd upon as a Wonder in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ten Leagues on this ſide of <hi>Dendera,</hi> at the
<hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> is <hi>Caſſr,</hi> a Village where is an old Convent, dedicated to <hi>Amba Balamon:</hi> Over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Village is the ancient Town <hi>Hu,</hi> where is yet a Convent dedicated to S.
<hi>Menna,</hi> but there was then no Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Two Leagues on this ſide of <hi>Hu,</hi> on the ſame Bank is
<hi>Bahgiura,</hi> at a little diſtance from the River: Its Port is called
<hi>Sahel;</hi> there is two Convents, one dedicated to S. <hi>Bidabe,</hi> the other to S. <hi>George.</hi> At two Leagues on this ſide of
<hi>Bahgiura,</hi> on the ſame Bank, is the Village <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liene,</hi> where is a very beautiful Church under ground, dedicated to the Bleſſed Virgin.
<hi>Girge,</hi> the chief Town of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Egypt,</hi> ſtands ſix Leagues from <hi>Beliene</hi> on this ſide.</p>
                  <p>Here ends the Relation of Father <hi>Portais.</hi> I could wiſh that this good man had given us a more exact account, and more at large of the Rarities that he ſaw in theſe places, for this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is ſuperficial.</p>
                  <p>The 14th of <hi>June,</hi> I went at <hi>Cairo</hi> to ſee the
<hi>Inchanted watering place,</hi> called in <hi>Arabick, Houd il meraſſet,</hi> which is under the Moſque of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106091:128"/>called <hi>Kalet it Kebſch,</hi> no Taveller hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoken of it.</p>
                  <p>It is a black Marble-ſtone, made like a Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, ſeven foot long, ariſing out of the ground about a foot and a half: The ſides, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, are adorned with little Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick Letters, as well as the Brims. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Cairo</hi> ſay, that in the time of the ancient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the ſick people did recover their health by drinking Water out of it; and that by the virtue of a <hi>Raſſem,</hi> or Charm, which the Prieſts of <hi>Egypt</hi> had given to it.</p>
                  <p>The 20th of this Month I went to ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Well which is in the Caſtle, commonly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s <hi>Well.</hi> Its top is ſquare, very large, cut in the Rock; it is about one hundred and twenty Perches deep, the Perch containing ſix foot. The water is drawn out with two Wheels, the one plac'd at the Mouth of the Well, and the other about threeſcore and fifteen Perches under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. There are two Oxen at each Wheel to turn them; the loweſt, which is fifty Perches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the water, ſerves to draw the water into a Baſon there on purpoſe; and from thence, the upper Wheel draws the water to the top. The Beaſts that work there, go up and down very commodiouſly by a great large Path, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the light through Windows cut on that ſide which looks to the water.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabian</hi> Authors call it <hi>Bir haleizun,</hi> or the <hi>Snails Well,</hi> becauſe there is a Path-way that winds round about. The people commonly ſay, that it was digg'd by Spirits; I am almoſt incline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe it, for I cannot conceive how men can compaſs ſo wonderful a work.</p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:106091:128"/>
                  <p>The Waters, as the Guardian told me, come out of the firm Rock, and yet increaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe as the River <hi>Nilus:</hi> But I have heard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, that they come out of the great <hi>Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> which is in old <hi>Cairo.</hi> Becauſe I could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the truth of it, I wiſh that ſome other Traveller would inform himſelf better.</p>
                  <p>They that think that <hi>Joſeph, Jacob</hi>'s Son, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be digged, are deceived, for the Caſtle of <hi>Cairo</hi> was built many Ages after <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s death; and it is the common opinion of all the <hi>Arabian</hi> Authors, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> dwelt at <hi>Memphis,</hi> which was on the other ſide of the River, near the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namids,</hi> and not on this ſide where <hi>Cairo</hi> ſtands.</p>
                  <p>The 9th of this Month they cryed about Town <hi>Ouf alla,</hi> that the River was riſen ſixteen Cubits high. The next day, being S.
<hi>Laurences</hi> day, they cut through the <hi>Calitz</hi> with Ceremony; but there was no great rejoycings, becauſe the <hi>Pacha</hi> had obſerv'd that before, and every <hi>Pacha</hi> performs it but once in his time.</p>
                  <p>On the 18th of the ſame Month there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a miſchance to a <hi>French</hi> Merchant, which diſcovers the wonderful jealouſie of the
<hi>Turks.</hi> As this Merchant was taking the air at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his houſe in the Even, on the <hi>Calitz</hi> ſide, a <hi>Janiſſary</hi> that lived over againſt him, thinking that he made ſigns to his Women and Slaves, ſhot off a Piſtol at him, and wounded him in the hand. The <hi>French</hi> Conſul could never obtain from the Juſtice of <hi>Cairo</hi> to cauſe this Villain to be puniſh'd.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Bonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corſe,</hi> before Conſul of <hi>Seyda,</hi> ſucceeded to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <pb n="250" facs="tcp:106091:129"/>
                     <hi>de Tyger,</hi> before Conſul at
<hi>Cairo,</hi> and landed at <hi>Boulac,</hi> in the company of many great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, upon a great Bark well trim'd, with a Flag of the Arms of
<hi>France</hi> on the Main Maſt.</p>
                  <p>At his arrival he ſaluted <hi>Boulac</hi> with five lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Braſs-Pieces of Canon, which were at the Stern of his Ship. He landed not at the <hi>Douane,</hi> for the Conſuls are free from that Viſit, but in a pleaſant houſe upon the River, near the <hi>Douane,</hi> until he had got leave from the <hi>Pacha</hi> to go to <hi>Cairo.</hi> As ſoon as he had received it, he mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Horſeback without more ado, and rode in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, with all the Merchants of his Nation riding on Aſſes. The
<hi>Pacha</hi> ſent none to bid him welcome; only the <hi>Venetian</hi> Conſul ſent his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to meet him, and his Horſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day, one of thoſe Swimmers, whom I have already mentioned, ſwum all along the <hi>Calitz,</hi> according to the Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>On the ſeventh of the Month, <hi>Ibrahim Pacha</hi> went from
<hi>Cairo</hi> in Pomp.</p>
                  <p>On the 29th, I went with Monſieur <hi>Bonnecorſe</hi> to
<hi>Adelia,</hi> a Suburb of <hi>Cairo,</hi> on the <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> ſide, where are the Tombs of the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſee the coming in of the new <hi>Pacha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not amiſs to mention here two Cuſtoms, which all the
<hi>Pacha</hi>'s ought to obſerve when they come firſt to this Government, and when they leave it.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Pacha,</hi> before he enters into <hi>Cairo,</hi> is bound to viſit the Tomb of <hi>Sciech il Sciafei,</hi> who is buried in the
<hi>Caraffe,</hi> for he is the Protector of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family; for the <hi>Turks</hi> following the Doctrines of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, believe <pb n="251" facs="tcp:106091:129"/>that he is able to obtain for them from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, a happy and peaceable Government: And when they depart, they are bound to render the ſame reſpects to the Tomb of <hi>Sultan Cajed Bey,</hi> though an Enemy of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Race, and one of the laſt lawful Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to thank him, becauſe he had ſuffered his Government to be without diſorders and diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Cuſtoms are ſo Religiouſly to be obſerved by the <hi>Pacha</hi>'s that the people of <hi>Cairo</hi> ſay, that they have ſeen ſome that have neglected or contemned them, to have been ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly depoſed, and to have met with unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their time.</p>
                  <p>I have heard ſay, that when <hi>Sultan Selimus</hi> had overcome the <hi>Mamelucs,</hi> he was afraid to go into <hi>Cairo,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of his Conqueſt, till <hi>Sciech il Sciafei</hi> appeared to him, to aſſure him, that he need not fear any thing. And that the next day when he made his Entry, an unknown perſon led his Horſe by the Bridle into the Town, and then vaniſh'd away.</p>
                  <p>When I had continued in ſo incommodious a City, as
<hi>Cairo</hi> is to the <hi>Francs,</hi> twenty Months, the fear of ſome miſhap which might have befallen me if the <hi>Turks</hi> had known that I bought up their Books, cauſed me to think upon my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and to ſecure my ſelf, I imagin'd <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> to be the moſt fit for my purpoſe. I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therefore to go thither: I left <hi>Cairo</hi> the
12th of <hi>October,</hi> 1673. to ſail to <hi>Roſetta;</hi> and becauſe the River was then fulleſt, a good Wind and a ſtrong Current carried us thither in two Nights and a day. From thence, I went aboard the ſame
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:106091:130"/>day in a Veſſel of a <hi>Greek</hi> bound for
<hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> I landed at <hi>Chio,</hi> an Iſland of the
<hi>Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lague,</hi> the 25th of <hi>November,</hi> where I ſtaid two Months and a few days, wondering at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſomneſs of this Iſland, and at the Civility of the Inhabitants to Strangers: I went to viſit tho famous Monaſtery of the Religious <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Neamoni,</hi> or of the <hi>Bleſſed and Only Virgin:</hi> I ſaw the Library, and all the other Rarities of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland. From thence I went to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the
27th of <hi>January,</hi> 1674. where I arrived the ſecond of
<hi>February,</hi> and ſtaid till the 13th of <hi>March.</hi> Then I went aboard with Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Embaſſadour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where I arrived the 24th of
<hi>March,</hi> being <hi>Holy Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 24th of <hi>July</hi> I went from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to the City <hi>Brouſſe,</hi> called by the <hi>Europeans Burſia,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and the ancient Seat of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours, to ſee the Hot Baths, the Tombs, and the ſtately Moſques of theſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours: I ſtaid there about eight days. On the fourth of <hi>September</hi> I went to the Iſle of <hi>Chio</hi> the ſecond time, to ſee the gathering up of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,</hi> a ſweet Gum, which begins the 14th of this Month, according to the <hi>Greek</hi> computation; and the 28th of <hi>October</hi> I returned to
<hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the ſecond of <hi>January,</hi> 1676. the day that I was to depart with the <hi>Caravan</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> that I might return the third time to <hi>Cairo,</hi> I found my ſelf oblig'd to go back for
<hi>France;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was then no <hi>French</hi> Ships in that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bound for <hi>France,</hi> only a ſmall Bark loaden
