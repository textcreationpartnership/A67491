            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO thee alone I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the peru≈øal of this Journal, which not only my ≈øelf, but ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judicious Per≈øons have thought worthy to appear in our Tongue, and among≈øt the <hi>Curio≈øo's</hi> of our Nation. The Author is well known to be a Man of Integrity, and one that ≈øcorns to impo≈øe upon the World an untruth; of which, <pb facs="tcp:106091:3"/>in this occa≈øion, nothing can tempt him to be guilty. If therefore ≈øome Particulars look with a ≈øtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable Countenance, be not ≈øo un≈øociable in thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øion, as to reject what≈øoever thou ha≈øt no demon≈øtration to prove. A ridiculous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and a pernicious Rule, which tends to deprive us of the benefit of many Knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, both in Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Matters. It is unlikely that ≈øuch a Per≈øon of di≈øcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and intere≈øt in the World, as he is known to be, ≈øhould ≈øo much forget his rea≈øon, as to <pb facs="tcp:106091:3"/>≈øub≈øcribe his Name to ≈øuch fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhoods, as may be ea≈øily di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the place of his ordinary abode. I confe≈øs ≈øome Ob≈øervations are trivial and ordinary, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will prove ≈øatisfactory to ≈øuch worthy Souls as de≈øire to know the pa≈ø≈øages of the World, and Foreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This Country of <hi>Egypt</hi> hath heretofore been the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Magazin of Learning, as well as of Provi≈øions: It hath flouri≈øhed in all Manual Arts, and the rare≈øt Sciences. No doubt but that there are yet to be ≈øeen ≈øome Monuments <pb facs="tcp:106091:4"/>of the Primitive Grandeur and Learning of the ancient Inhabitants: As therefore
<hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølebius</hi> hath judg'd them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be vi≈øited in his Travels, and afterwards of this account which he gives in Print, I think them not unworthy of thy knowledge; which thou maye≈øt perhaps improve in the interpretation of ≈øome ob≈øcure pa≈ø≈øages of holy Writ, and for other purpo≈øes according to thy Profe≈ø≈øion.</p>

               <p>IN the Year 1671. about the 8th of <hi>May,</hi> I was at
<hi>Mar≈øeilles,</hi> with an intention to ≈øail again into <hi>Egypt:</hi> for that purpo≈øe I found an opportunity, the Ship the <hi>Three Kings,</hi> Commanded by an Aged Captain named <hi>Artaut,</hi> was ready to depart for
<hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretta.</hi> I went aboard, and ≈øet ≈øail from the Port the 20th of the ≈øame Month, ≈øtrait towards <hi>Malta,</hi> where we remained five days, and after directed our Cour≈øe to <hi>Lernica,</hi> in the I≈øland of
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> Merchants make their abode; on the Sea-≈øide, looking towards the <hi>South,</hi> we arrived the 17th of
<hi>June.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as I ≈øet foot a≈øhore, I fell de≈øperately ≈øick of an ordinary Di≈øea≈øe to all Strangers, proceeding from the Infection of the Air, that is an Enemy to them: But my Di≈øtemper could not hinder me from going to <hi>Nico≈øia,</hi> the chief City of the I≈øland. When I felt my Malady in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øing every day, and the rather through the <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106091:5"/>dangerous Infection of the Plague which was then in the I≈øland, I re≈øolved to be carried to <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> the neare≈øt and mo≈øt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Port where the <hi>French</hi> Nation hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øul: While≈øt I was at <hi>Nico≈øia,</hi> Captain <hi>Artaut</hi> was departed with his Ship for <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> and the 26th of <hi>June</hi> I went aboard another Ship in the Haven of <hi>Lernica,</hi> and the next day with a favourable Wind we landed at <hi>Tripoli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though I had for≈øaken the infectious I≈øland, the di≈øea≈øe of my body for≈øook me not, but grew to that pa≈øs, that I prepar'd my ≈øelf, as Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity injoyns us, to leave the World: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs, at the end of 35 days, my di≈øtemper being weary to torment me, ≈øuffer'd me to recover a little ≈øtrength; and though I was but weak, I went aboard a Ship bound for <hi>Alepo</hi> the fir≈øt of <hi>Septemb.</hi> arriv'd the 13th, and abode there four Months.</p>
               <p>About the la≈øt of <hi>Decemb.</hi> I went to
<hi>Dama≈øcus,</hi> where I remain'd a Month, and from thence to
<hi>Seyda,</hi> where I was al≈øo two Months.</p>
               <p>My purpo≈øe is not to give any account of the Curio≈øities of
<hi>Lernica,</hi> of <hi>Nico≈øia,</hi> of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> of
<hi>Alepo,</hi> of <hi>Dama≈øcus,</hi> and of <hi>Seyda.</hi> The≈øe Towns are ≈øufficiently known to all the World, by the many Relations already publi≈øhed of the <hi>Levant</hi> Countries: Be≈øides the ≈øhortne≈øs of the time of my abode there, together with the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Quartan Feaver which kept me compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øixteen Months, ≈øuffered me not to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any ≈øuch matters. I ≈øhall therefore in this Treati≈øe give an account only of what Curio≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I have ≈øeen in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where during the ≈øpace of twenty Months I have had the lei≈øure and opportunities to take a view of the mo≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106091:5"/>things, with the greate≈øt exactne≈øs and care imaginable, which hath never been done of this famous and beautiful Country till now.</p>
               <p>The 19th day of <hi>February,</hi> 1672. I took Ship at
<hi>Seyda,</hi> a Town of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> to ≈øail for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mietta</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but a contrary Wind ro≈øe, and brought us back to
<hi>Seyda</hi> again, where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd till the 16th of <hi>March.</hi> I went then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and met with a favourable Gale, that drove us very happily to <hi>Bogas,</hi> which lies at the Mouth of the River <hi>Nilus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think it convenient, before we proceed, to give a general account and de≈øcription of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that the things that I ≈øhall hereafter mention may better be under≈øtood.</p>

                  <p>It ≈øtretcheth it ≈øelf in length from the City of

I ≈øay here nothing, but according to the Relation of the Authors that have examin'd it.</p>
                  <p>It is divided, according to the accounts of the <hi>Divan,</hi> or Trea≈øury, into three parts: 1. Into <hi>Said,</hi> or the Upper
<hi>Egypt,</hi> which begins at <hi>Sint,</hi> and extends as far as
<hi>I≈øvan.</hi> 2. Into <hi>Vo≈øtani,</hi> or the middle <hi>Egypt,</hi> in re≈øpect of the <hi>Said</hi> and <hi>Cairo:</hi> And 3.

                  <p>The Upper <hi>Egypt,</hi> or that part of it which is habitable and u≈øeful, is very narrow.

                  <p>The Inferiour part is wider: The Inhabitants reckon about 70 miles from <hi>Damietta</hi> to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> the mo≈øt We≈øtern-Town upon the Sea-Coa≈øt.</p>

                     <hi>Egypt</hi> was always governed by Kings, but the Royal Seats have not always continued the ≈øame, for the Conquerours have altered them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their plea≈øure.</p>

<hi>Memphis,</hi> which was the Seat of the Ancient Kings of the Race of
<hi>Coptus,</hi> till <hi>Nabuchodonozor</hi> had ≈øack'd it. When
<hi>Alexander the Great</hi> had built <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he made it the Principal City, where all the ≈øucceeding Kings of the <hi>Greeks</hi> made their Re≈øidence for nine hundred years, till the <hi>Arabians</hi> had taken
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and made <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtat</hi> Metropolis. But when
<hi>Giauher,</hi> the General of <hi>Meez le Din-alla</hi> had built
<hi>Cairo,</hi> about the year of the <hi>Hegeira</hi> 362. he called it
<hi>Dar il Memleke,</hi> that is the Royal Seat, which it hath been ever ≈øince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egypt</hi> hath been govern'd by three ≈øeveral ≈øorts of
<hi>Mahumetan</hi> Princes, ≈øince the <hi>Arabians</hi> took it from the
<hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt were named <hi>Omara Ma≈ø≈ør,</hi> or Lords of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> without any other Title. They were all <hi>Arabians,</hi> and Succe≈ø≈øors of <hi>Amru ibn il A≈øs,</hi> who was the fir≈øt Conquerour, and after to <hi>Abu il Fevares,</hi> the la≈øt of that Race. We reckon one hundred and twelve Princes of <hi>Egypt,</hi> during the ≈øpace of 337 Years, ≈øeven Months, and twenty Days. Their Conque≈øt happen'd about twenty years after the <hi>Hegeira,</hi> and ended in the year 358. They all dwelt at
<hi>Fo≈øtat Ma≈ø≈øer,</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øecond Race of the <hi>Arabians</hi> were called
<hi>Caliphs.</hi> They began to take that Title, when Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Abuha≈ø≈øein Giauher</hi> had built <hi>Cairo</hi> by the Order of
<hi>Meez le Din-alba,</hi> who was then Prince of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and Conquer'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> and took it from the <hi>Arabians. Egypt</hi> was afterwards go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by its <hi>Caliphs</hi> about 108 Years, 4 Months, and 22 Days; that is, to the death of <hi>Adet le <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106091:8"/>Din-alla,</hi> who was the la≈øt and Eleventh <hi>Caliph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third ≈øort, named <hi>Sultans</hi> or <hi>Soldans,</hi> ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded immediately after; of them there have been of four Nations.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt, who was the Po≈øterity of a certain
<hi>Eijub,</hi> were called <hi>Sultans Curdes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ≈øecond came from beyond the Seas, &amp; were named
<hi>Mamaluk Turks,</hi> becau≈øe they had been before Slaves, and ≈øold by the Merchants of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantinople</hi> to the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who cau≈øed them to be brought up and in≈øtructed in all Martial Di≈øcipline. When the King was dead, one of the≈øe Slaves was cho≈øen to ≈øucceed in the Throne.</p>
                  <p>The third ≈øort were ≈øtiled <hi>Mamaluks Circa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> becau≈øe they came originally from
<hi>Circa≈ø≈øia,</hi> and were brought thither by the Merchants as the former, and ≈øold al≈øo as Slaves to the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who cau≈øed them to be al≈øo train'd up as the former, unto whom they ≈øucceeded in the Regal Dignity and Command.</p>
                  <p>The fourth ≈øort, who are now in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, are the
<hi>Sultans</hi> of the Race of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Egypt</hi> is inhabited at pre≈øent by <hi>Copties, Moors, Arabians, Turks, Greeks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Franks,</hi> and other ≈øtrange Nations; but as they are not nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, they de≈øerve not to be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> or <hi>Copts</hi> are the Natural Inhabitants of the Country, thus called, as we have already ≈øaid, of
<hi>Coptus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mi≈øraim,</hi> who was King of <hi>Egypt</hi> after his Father.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moors,</hi> who are named by the <hi>Arabians Aulad il Arab,</hi> or Children of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> are <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106091:8"/>likewi≈øe as well as the <hi>Copties</hi> de≈øcended from the ≈øame Father, but they are become <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and it may be ≈øince they have Conquered <hi>Egypt,</hi> there are ≈øome among≈øt them yet that are come from the <hi>Arabians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> are a people of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and though they live in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they have no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the
<hi>Moors,</hi> who are originally of the Country. They are of many differing Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, govern'd by their ≈øeveral Chieftains, whom I ≈øhall mention in the ≈øequel of this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have e≈øtabli≈øh'd them≈øelves there ≈øince <hi>Sultan Selimus</hi> conquer'd <hi>Egypt.</hi> The≈øe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Country, defend it, and act in all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of State.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> that live there now, and that make yet profe≈ø≈øion of the Chri≈øtian Religion, have been invited thither by the great Trade of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> for there is no ≈øign of the Ancient
<hi>Greeks,</hi> who e≈øtabli≈øh'd them≈øelves there when <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great</hi> conquer'd <hi>Egypt;</hi> if there be any, they are mingled with the
<hi>Copties,</hi> and are called by their names.</p>
                  <p>And becau≈øe the <hi>Greeki≈øh</hi> Emperours that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Council of <hi>Chalcedonia</hi> were glad to incourage a Party in
<hi>Egypt</hi> again≈øt the <hi>Copties,</hi> ≈øworn Enemies of that Council, they protected there the <hi>Greeks</hi> that went thither from
<hi>Greece,</hi> that ≈øubmitted to that Council, and gave them means to e≈øtabli≈øh them≈øelves in this Kingdom; ≈øince that time the
<hi>Greeki≈øh</hi> Religion hath been there profe≈ø≈øed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> have always lived there; at pre≈øent they are very numerous, and are in great repute, <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106091:9"/>chiefly at
<hi>Cairo,</hi> and in the Maritime Towns: but unle≈øs it be in ≈øuch places there are none to be found, for if their occa≈øions call them into the Country, they u≈øually di≈øgui≈øe and hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; for when the Country-people find them out, they abu≈øe and affront them ≈øtrangely.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> at pre≈øent in <hi>Egypt</hi> are not nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, in compari≈øon of what they have been heretofore; for in the days of <hi>Amru ibn il A≈ø≈ø,</hi> who took this Country from the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> there was of this Nation ≈øix hundred thou≈øand that paid him Tribute: but now, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their own Patriarch, there is ≈øcarce ten or fifteen thou≈øand. One of the Cau≈øes of this decrea≈øe, was their con≈øtancy in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Religion, in the time of the
<hi>Romans;</hi> their Governours were ≈øo furious again≈øt them for that rea≈øon, that they have put to death milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at a time: for the Hi≈øtories tell us of the Governour under <hi>Diocle≈øian</hi> the Emperour, who ma≈ø≈øacred in one night, at <hi>Chri≈øtmas,</hi> four≈øcore thou≈øand; who are buried upon Mount <hi>Achmim</hi> in the Upper <hi>Egypt.</hi> And at another time near <hi>I≈øna,</hi> either the ≈øame Governour, or another, put to death ≈øo many that they were not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, for they covered four≈øcore <hi>Fiddans,</hi> or Furlongs, with their dead martyr'd bodies: The
<hi>Fiddan</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> contains 400 Ca≈ø≈øabs or Yards, every Yard is 6 Cubits.</p>
                  <p>Another Cau≈øe of their decrea≈øe in the days of the Chri≈øtian Emperours, was their ob≈øtinacy in maintaining the Errour of
<hi>Dio≈øcorus,</hi> one of their Patriarchs, concerning one Nature, one Will, and Per≈øon in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, which cau≈øed them to ≈øuffer almo≈øt the ≈øame de≈øtructions as <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106091:9"/>they had done formerly under the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours for the Chri≈øtian Faith: For when the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours offered to force them to leave the Errour of <hi>Dio≈øcorus,</hi> and to embrace the Faith e≈øtabli≈øhed in the Council of <hi>Chalcedone,</hi> and when they found them di≈øobedient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible; they made u≈øe of the Sword to compa≈øs their de≈øign. Among≈øt the re≈øt the Emperour
<hi>Ju≈øtinian,</hi> as <hi>Macriz</hi> ≈øaith in his Hi≈øtory of the Patriarchs, cau≈øed two hundred thou≈øand <hi>Copties</hi> to be killed at
<hi>Alexandria</hi> for that very purpo≈øe. I ≈øhall not mention the Cruelties of the other Emperours his Succe≈ø≈øors exerci≈øed upon them. So that ≈øuch as ≈øurvived after ≈øuch like Ma≈ø≈øacres, when they ≈øaw the danger that attended the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion of this Opinion, and of appearing in the Cities, they retreated into the wilderne≈øs, or withdrew them≈øelves into the Mona≈øteries, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpair, to lead a Mona≈øtical life, without marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or thinking to propagate their Nation.</p>
                  <p>After this, the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kings and Princes, that have governed <hi>Egypt</hi> ≈øince the Chri≈øtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, when they found them rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt their Government, have not ≈øpared them. They have killed the Chief, ≈øold for Slaves the Wives and Children of others, ≈øo that the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ≈øort have been forc'd to turn <hi>Mahometans.</hi> By this means, after ≈øo many evils, this Nation is reduced to a very ≈ømall number.</p>
                  <p>They were anciently Heathens, every City had a God to adore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abu≈øir,</hi> or the old <hi>Bu≈øiris,</hi> wor≈øhipped a Calf. <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the ancient <hi>Racotis,</hi> adored
<hi>Serapis</hi> of Stone. <hi>Achmim,</hi> which is the old <hi>Panos,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>Apollo. Bana</hi> wor≈øhipped a Dog. <hi>Ba≈ø≈øa,</hi>

I have taken all the≈øe particulars out of an old Manu≈øcript in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick, that I have ≈øeen in the Mona≈øtry of S. <hi>Anthony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ≈øince the coming of our Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt, they have been ≈øome of the fir≈øt that have embraced the Chri≈øtian Religion, at the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apo≈øtle S. <hi>Mark.</hi> They have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the right Faith, till <hi>Dio≈øcorus</hi> their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch fell into this Here≈øie, That in Je≈øus Chri≈øt there was but one Nature, one Sub≈øtance, one Will, and one Operation. This Errour with its Author was condemned in the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedone,</hi> and ≈øuch as receive it are counted as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore they have been per≈øecuted by the Chri≈øtian Emperours in times pa≈øt.</p>
                  <p>But becau≈øe I treat more amply of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Eccle≈øia≈øtical Ceremonies in another Book named the Church of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> which I compo≈øed for that purpo≈øe when I was at

                  <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> have often changed their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The fir≈øt and ancient Language of the Country was that of the <hi>Copties,</hi> which was u≈øed <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106091:10"/>all the time that their Kings reigned in

<hi>Arabians,</hi> called in their Language <hi>Omara Said.</hi> They dwelt then at <hi>H√∫,</hi> which is, the old <hi>Dio≈øpolis,</hi> ≈øurnamed the Upper, di≈øtant from <hi>Girg√©</hi> about a days journey, and on the ≈øame ≈øide of the River <hi>Nilus</hi> as we go up: But when
<hi>Girg√©</hi> was inlarg'd by time, and <hi>H√∫</hi> fell to decay, the Princes of <hi>Said</hi> ≈øettled their abode at
<hi>Girg√©,</hi> which hath been always the Chief City ≈øince that time till now.</p>
                  <p>About fifty years ago the <hi>Turks</hi> drove away from thence tho≈øe <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes, and in their ≈øtead they put the
<hi>Sangiac-Beys,</hi> who are Natural <hi>Turks;</hi> the fir≈øt was named
<hi>Soliman-Gianballat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This puts me in mind of a mi≈øtake of <hi>James Albertus</hi> in his di≈øcour≈øe of <hi>Egypt;</hi> he ≈øaith, that <hi>Said</hi> was about 60 years ago a Kingdom of it ≈øelf, to which the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> did u≈øually a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign a <hi>Pacha.</hi> This Errour hath no ground: Fir≈øt, becau≈øe in all the Hi≈øtories, ancient and new, of the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> the Province of <hi>Said</hi> is never nam'd
<hi>Memleke</hi> a Kingdom, nor <hi>Pachalick</hi> the Government of a
<hi>Pacha,</hi> but only <hi>Arde Said, i. e.</hi> the Country of
<hi>Said;</hi> and its Rulers, were not nam'd Kings, or <hi>Pachas,</hi> but only <hi>Omara Said,</hi> or Princes of <hi>Said.</hi> Secondly, becau≈øe all the Governours of the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Race, who have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd it ≈øince the driving out of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes, are never call'd in the Regi≈øters of the <hi>Divan,</hi> nor of the common people, otherwi≈øe than
<hi>Sangiac-Beys,</hi> two only excepted, who were <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106091:11"/>named
<hi>Pachas,</hi> becau≈øe they had been <hi>Pachas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were the Governours of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and though they did bear this Title, they were always ≈øubject to the <hi>Pachas</hi> of <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is certain, the Province of <hi>Said</hi> is very large; and if it were all inhabited, and all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nur'd, as is the lower <hi>Egypt,</hi> its
<hi>Bey</hi> might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the <hi>Pacha</hi> of <hi>Cairo</hi> for pre-eminence. They have often endeavour'd to free them≈øelves from his Command, but becau≈øe the inhabited Country is very narrow, and the Villages and Towns ruinated, they could never ≈øucceed in their de≈øign.</p>
                  <p>Neverthele≈øs, the Government is much like that of the
<hi>Pachas</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> for he hath the ≈øame Officers to attend him, a <hi>Chiaoux-Bachi,</hi> or a Captain of the <hi>Chiaoux,</hi> an Interpreter, an <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and other
<hi>Aga</hi>'s of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Orders, named in their Language
<hi>Boulouks,</hi> who are taken out of the Souldiery of <hi>Cairo,</hi> and are paid out of the Rever≈øions of the <hi>Divan.</hi> He hath likewi≈øe his
<hi>Divan Catebi,</hi> or <hi>Chancellour;</hi> and in truth, he hath all the Priviledges of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> but he hath not the Title, nor the Quality, nor ever had.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Bey</hi> gives to the <hi>Pacha</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> as <hi>James Albertus</hi> ≈øaith, forty Pur≈øes every year; be≈øides, he ≈øends him fifty Hor≈øes, fifty Mules, and one hundred Camels. He gives al≈øo ten Pur≈øes to his <hi>Kehaja,</hi> and his <hi>Aga:</hi> And for the Tax of his Country, he pays to the <hi>Divan</hi> of <hi>Cairo</hi> one hundred and fifty <hi>Ardebs</hi> of Wheat; and when he gives other Grain, he delivers one <hi>Ardeb</hi> and a half, in≈øtead of one <hi>Ardeb</hi> of Wheat; and be≈øides, he ≈øends four hundred and four≈øcore <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106091:12"/>Pur≈øes, each Pur≈øe containing five hundred Crowns: And when he is in the la≈øt year of his Government, he is bound to cau≈øe all the Lands of his Government to be ≈øown which the River hath watered, and for his Expences the <hi>Divan</hi> gives him an Allowance.</p>

                  <p>IN regard the word <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> is often repeated in this Treati≈øe, I have thought it needful, before I proceed any farther in the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to mention its Origine, and the number and imployment of the <hi>Ca≈øciefs:</hi> By this means we ≈øhall ≈øee that all <hi>Egypt</hi> is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into little Provinces, or Governments.</p>

<hi>Winter,</hi> begins about the middle of <hi>December:</hi> It is a delightful time, unle≈øs in the ≈øeven days which the Arabians call <hi>Berd il agiuz,</hi> or the cold of the old Hag; they begin about the 7th of
<hi>February,</hi> and continue till the 14th; the Mornings are then very cold, the Sky is cloudy, the Rains fall, and the Winds are commonly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry boi≈øterous.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>Winter</hi> is there very mild, per≈øons of E≈øtate wear Furr'd Gowns, from the Month of <hi>November,</hi> till the Month of <hi>March,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of any great cold, for there is ≈øcarce any, but becau≈øe then the Weather is variable, and they fear to be incommoded with the di≈øtempers which this changeable weather produceth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Summer</hi> is the wor≈øt and mo≈øt trouble≈øom ≈øea≈øon, becau≈øe of the exce≈ø≈øive heats of the hot Winds, and the dangerous di≈øea≈øes that are rife, chiefly at that time, which the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> call <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øins,</hi> which we name <hi>Ea≈øter.</hi> This dangerous ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon begins about the <hi>Ea≈øter</hi>-Monday of the
<hi>Copties,</hi> and ends at their <hi>Whit≈øon</hi>-Monday. About this time the Winds, called by the <hi>Arabians Meri≈ø≈øi,</hi> are boi≈øterous; they are ≈øo hot and trouble≈øome, that they are ready to ≈øtifle the breath, and they rai≈øe in the Air ≈øo much Straw and Sand, that the Sky is darkned. This Sand is ≈øo ≈øubtil, that it penetrates through every little chink and hole.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:106091:15"/>
                  <p>About this time Malignant Fevers commonly reign, Dy≈øenteries, and many other Di≈øea≈øes; the lea≈øt is incurable, if the nece≈ø≈øary Remedies be not applied in time: And when the≈øe winds blow, the bodies that are not di≈øtemper'd, are ca≈øt down, and not well.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe Southerly winds blow not every day in this ≈øea≈øon, nor every year in the ≈øame manner and fury; for in the year 1672. they blew but twelve times, and the next year but twice, and that very moderately; other fre≈øher and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomer winds blew the re≈øt of the time. It is not po≈ø≈øible to expre≈øs the joy of the people, when the≈øe Southerly winds favour them, and are mild.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary time of Rains and Winds, which might be compared with our <hi>Autumn,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> and continues till <hi>January,</hi> and <hi>February;</hi> though at
<hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Rains fall at other times, becau≈øe of the Seas that are ≈øo near. At the Eve of the
<hi>Penteco≈øt,</hi> in the year 1672. the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was full of Rain at
<hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> and the next day followed a very thick Mi≈øt. On the 24th day of <hi>November,</hi> in the ≈øame year, the Rains fell ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moderately at <hi>Cairo;</hi> the Sky was ob≈øcure, and full of wind; and on the tenth, eleventh, fourteenth and fifteenth in the ≈øame Month, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry furious Rains fell. By this you may ≈øee, that it is a great errour to ≈øay, that it never Rains in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have often ≈øeen in my Travels, that the weather hath been ≈øo mi≈øty and moi≈øt, that my Beard and Cloaths have been ≈øo wet, that a ≈øhowre of Rain could not have wetted them more; and that which is wonderful is, that this <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106091:16"/>happened in a ≈øea≈øon that none ever expected it. During ≈øeveral mornings in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> in the year 1672. in my travelling from <hi>Damiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> to <hi>Cairo,</hi> the ≈øame thing happen'd to me in the Month of <hi>June</hi> at
<hi>Ro≈øetta;</hi> and in the Month of <hi>September</hi> at
<hi>Bene≈øuef;</hi> and in <hi>October,</hi> in my return from the Mona≈øtery of S. <hi>Anthony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The≈øe wet Mi≈øts are more frequent about <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> than in other places. They begin u≈øually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Month of
<hi>November,</hi> before the ri≈øing of the Sun, and continue all the
<hi>Winter.</hi> Some happen in other ≈øea≈øons of the year, and many times in <hi>Summer,</hi> as I have taken notice in the year 1672. in the beginning of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back from <hi>Fium</hi> to
<hi>Mocanan,</hi> a Village about four hours travelling from <hi>Cairo,</hi> I ≈øaw upon the Town ≈øo thick a Mi≈øt, that I could not di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, nor the <hi>Pyramids</hi> that are near, though the Air was clear where I ≈øtood.</p>
                  <p>In all the ≈øea≈øons of the year, when the nights are ≈øerene, there is ≈øo much Dew that falls, that it may very well be taken for a little ≈øhowre; but when the Sky is cloudy, there falls no Dew. Were it not for the≈øe Dews, there would be no Gra≈øs nor Corn, the Trees would bear no Fruit, the wild Bea≈øts in the De≈øarts could not live where there are no Fountains nor Rivers, and where the Rains fall but ≈øeldom. Thunders are not often heard; in all the time that I was in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> I heard this noi≈øe but twice, on the fir≈øt day of <hi>January,</hi> and on the fourth of
<hi>May,</hi> 1673.</p>
                  <p>I have already ≈øpoken of the two chief Winds that blow in
<hi>Egypt, Meri≈ø≈øi</hi> and <hi>Maltem.</hi> I mu≈øt further take notice, that not only the <hi>Southern</hi> Winds are named <hi>Meri≈ø≈øi,</hi> but al≈øo the Ea≈øtern. <pb n="25" facs="tcp:106091:16"/>They blow commonly twice every year; at <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter,</hi> called (as I have already ≈øaid) <hi>Cam≈øin;</hi> and from the Month of <hi>November,</hi> till the middle of <hi>February.</hi> They are helpful to tho≈øe that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel down the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> and to the Ships that ≈øail from the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> through the Red-Sea to <hi>Sues:</hi> But they are contrary to tho≈øe that go up the River: From hence it ≈øometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that Travellers are 30 days going up from <hi>Cairo</hi> to <hi>Girge,</hi> which Voyage is ea≈øily perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 8 or 10 days when the other winds blow.</p>
                  <p>The Winds called <hi>Maltem</hi> or <hi>Teij√°b</hi> are We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly Winds: They begin about twelve days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rain falls, and la≈øt till the Month of <hi>November;</hi> during that time ≈øcarce any other Wind blows. The Winds called <hi>Meri≈ø≈øi</hi> are hot, they ≈øpoil the Corn, and are hurtful to every thing; but the≈øe nouri≈øh and refre≈øh, not only the Corn, but are comfortable to Man and Bea≈øt, for they are cooling, and give ≈øtrength.</p>
                  <p>They ≈øtop the Mouth of the River, and cau≈øe the Waves to ≈øend back the water of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which makes it to ≈øtop and ≈øwell over the Banks to water the Earth, and fill all the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels with water. In their ≈øea≈øons they begin to blow about Noon, and continue till midnight; but between midnight, and the Noon of the next day, they ≈øeldom blow, or very faintly.</p>

<hi>which is about</hi> 12 <hi>Degrees from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial towards the We≈øt, and in the Province of</hi> Saca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hala, <hi>inhabited by the</hi> Agaus
<hi>in a Field of no great extent, incompa≈ø≈øed about with many high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, there is a little Lake over which one may ca≈øt a ≈øtone, full of Bu≈øhes and low Trees, whereof the Roots are ≈øo thick and intangled, that in Summer one may walk upon them.

                  </p>
                  <p>We mu≈øt con≈øider be≈øides, that when <hi>Nilus</hi> is fallen down the la≈øt Cataract near <hi>I≈øvan,</hi> it runs from the
<hi>South</hi> to the <hi>North</hi> very ≈ølowly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it ≈øelf below <hi>Boulac</hi> into two great Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the one meets the Sea at
<hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Damietta.</hi> This latter divides it ≈øelf into another Current at <hi>Sciobret il yemen,</hi> a Village ≈øcituate on the <hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> about half-way between
<hi>Cairo</hi> and <hi>Damietta,</hi> which runs into the Sea at
<hi>Brullos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be≈øides the≈øe three branches, there is a fourth which is artificial, and full of water; but about thirty days of the year, it begins at a Village <pb n="29" facs="tcp:106091:18"/>called <hi>Latf,</hi> on the
<hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> in going to <hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> about thirty miles from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where the waters of this Current run into the Sea; therefore the <hi>Egyptians</hi> reckon it among≈øt the true Mouths of the River <hi>Nilus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not whether be≈øides the≈øe four there be any other, as
<hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> affirm, for they reckon about ≈øeven. But <hi>Egypt</hi> is much alter'd; ≈øo that there is no appearance nor remembrance of the ≈øeven Cities where they were, as they ≈øay.</p>
                  <p>When I was at <hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> I enquir'd from the Inhabitants concerning this particular, but they could not give me any account, but only of the≈øe four. Some told me, that be≈øides the great Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent at
<hi>Damietta,</hi> there was another artificial Channel at <hi>Gaza,</hi> where the waters did run into the Sea, but I cannot believe it: but if this were true, <hi>Gaza</hi> is not in <hi>Egypt;</hi> therefore it cannot be one of the ≈øeven Mouths of the River <hi>Nilus</hi> ≈øpoken of by the Ancient Geographers. I could wi≈øh that ≈øome other curious Traveller would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them out, and tell us the truth.</p>
                  <p>This is remarkable of <hi>Nilus:</hi> 1. That it begins to increa≈øe and decrea≈øe on a certain day preci≈øely. 2. That when it fir≈øt increa≈øeth it grows green. 3. That afterwards it appears red; and 4. That it changeth its Channel ≈øometimes.</p>
                  <p>The day in which it begins to increa≈øe is year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the 12th of
<hi>June</hi> of the <hi>Copties,</hi> or the 17th day of our <hi>June,</hi> on which day they ob≈øerve the Fea≈øt of S. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, on which day the drops fall. Now the≈øe drops are nothing el≈øe, according to the judgment of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, but the Mercies and Ble≈ø≈øings of God:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106091:19"/>They believe on that day God ≈øends the Arch-Angel S.
<hi>Michael</hi> to cau≈øe the River to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. This is the common Opinion of the people: But the Learned ≈øay, that the≈øe drops is a kind of a Dew which falls towards the la≈øt quarter of the night, near the morning; and which cau≈øeth the River to be fruitful, purifies the Air from all the infection of <hi>Cum≈øin,</hi> and gives ≈øtrength and vertue to all things upon which it falls.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe drops are doubtle≈øs the only cau≈øe of the fruitfulne≈øs of <hi>Nilus:</hi> this is ea≈øily ≈øeen; for as ≈øoon as this Dew is fallen, the water begins to be corrupt, and to be of a greeni≈øh colour; this colour increa≈øeth more and more, till the River appears as a Lake cover'd all over with Mo≈øs.</p>
                  <p>This colour is to be ≈øeen not only in its great Channel, but al≈øo in all the Ponds and Branches that come from thence, only the Ci≈øterns keep the water pure.</p>
                  <p>Some years this green colour continues about 20 days, and ≈øometimes more, but never above 40. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> call this time, when the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is green, <hi>il chad raviat,</hi> for they ≈øuffer much, becau≈øe the water is corrupt, without ta≈øte, and unwhole≈øome, and that good water is very rare.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe drops or Dew purifies the Air, for as ≈øoon as it falls, the Plague cea≈øeth to be mortal, none dies of it; the Air is whole≈øome, all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtempers cea≈øe, and if any per≈øon grows ≈øick, he never dies.</p>
                  <p>This Dew gives life to every thing; and when it falls upon the Wheat, it cau≈øeth it to continue many years without corruption, or worms, and is far more nouri≈øhing than that Corn upon which it never falls; For this cau≈øe they never <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106091:19"/>hou≈øe the Corn of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> in the Barns, till this Dew is fallen upon it, that it might keep the longer without worms.</p>
                  <p>The increa≈øe of the River proceeds from ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral cau≈øes; the fir≈øt and the chief is, the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation cau≈øed in it by this Dew, which falls at the time mentioned before.</p>
                  <p>The continual Rains of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> that come in <hi>July, Augu≈øt,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> which is the Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter of that Country, and the great Torrents of water that run down from the Mountains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rivers that flow into <hi>Nilus,</hi> may be look'd upon as another cau≈øe of this increa≈øe, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive that the fermentation can continue
100 days, and cau≈øe it alone to increa≈øe ≈øo much as it is wont.</p>
                  <p>The third cau≈øe, in my judgment, are the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterly winds, called <hi>Mae≈øtrals,</hi> and by the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians Maltem,</hi> which begin to blow, as I have ≈øaid, about 12 days before the Dew falls; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the fifth day of <hi>June,</hi> and continue after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards about four Months without alteration. They blow ≈øtrait into the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fre≈øh water from coming out, ≈øo that it returns back, and cau≈øeth the River to ≈øwell.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe ≈øame Winds have cau≈øed ≈øeveral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and namely Mon≈øieur <hi>Burattini</hi> to affirm, that the River ob≈øerves not a preci≈øe day to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe, but that it happens ≈øome years ≈øooner, others later; becau≈øe before the 17th day of <hi>June,</hi> the water did ≈øeem to ≈øwell; but this is no real increa≈øe, the winds <hi>Mae≈øtrals</hi> are the cau≈øes of this appearance.</p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> a≈øcrib'd the cau≈øe of the ≈øwelling of <hi>Nilus</hi> to a ≈øuper≈øtitious cu≈øtom.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106091:20"/>They bought a young Damo≈øel, adorned her with rich attire, and afterward ca≈øt her as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice into the River, on the 12th day of their <hi>Baony,</hi> or <hi>June:</hi> But when <hi>Amru-ibn il a≈ø≈ø</hi> had conquer'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> and taken it from the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> he aboli≈øh'd this damnable Cu≈øtom; which was ob≈øerved in that time, as <hi>Gaznevi</hi> a famous <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Hi≈øtorian ≈øaith.
<hi>Amru</hi> commanded the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> to forbear and leave that act of cruelty; in that year it happen'd that the River did not increa≈øe, which caus'd the people to ≈øu≈øpect and fear a great Famine, in≈øomuch that they re≈øolved to depart out of the Kingdom. This cau≈øed <hi>Amru ibn il a≈ø≈ø</hi> to write to <hi>Amru ibn il Chottab,</hi> a <hi>Califf</hi> of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> to de≈øire his advice. This <hi>Califf</hi> ≈øent him a Letter written with his own hand for the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> commanding him to read it, and to ca≈øt it into the water; which as ≈øoon as <hi>Amru</hi> had performed, the waters ro≈øe 16 Cubits in one night, the 14th of
<hi>September,</hi> which is commonly the la≈øt day of its increa≈øe. This was ≈øufficient to water the Country, and ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the people.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Country that are ignorant of the true cau≈øes of this increa≈øe, imagine that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a large Pond in
<hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in the River it ≈øelf, which the <hi>Aby≈ø≈øins</hi> begin to open about the 12th of <hi>June,</hi> and by degrees let out the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more and more, till the 14th of <hi>September,</hi> at which time they begin to ≈øhut it again; but this is a fooli≈øh fancy of the
<hi>Copties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as the green colour is gone, the River <hi>Nilus</hi> begins to become red, and very muddy; 'tis then no doubt but the fermentation is pa≈øs'd, and that the waters of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> are arriv'd in
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> 
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:106091:20"/>which are of that colour, becau≈øe of the red Earth which the furious torrents from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains carry into the River; for it is not po≈ø≈øible that the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is very black, ≈øhould give it that colour. In the year 1673. in the beginning of
<hi>July,</hi> the water began to be red, which continued till the end of
<hi>December,</hi> the time that the River returns to its ordinary bigne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>They have an art to make this muddy water as clear as Cry≈øtal. As ≈øoon as the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers have fill'd their Ve≈ø≈øels, they rub them in the in≈øide with a Pa≈øte made with pounded Almonds, which cau≈øeth the water to become in a ≈øhort time very clear.</p>
                  <p>In the places where this Pa≈øte is not to be found, they u≈øe for that purpo≈øe the Kernels of Apricocks, pounded in the ≈øame manner. I was told, that the Flower of little Beans could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ≈øame effect. The
<hi>Egyptians</hi> believe, that the River <hi>Nilus</hi> decrea≈øeth al≈øo at a certain day; namely, the 17th of their <hi>September,</hi> and the 24th of ours, the day which they ob≈øerve in remembrance of the Exaltation of the Holy Cro≈øs. They are ≈øo fully per≈øwaded of it, that if any ≈øhould deny it, he would be look'd upon as ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>The occa≈øion of this belief, as I conceive, is,</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe the next day after this Fe≈øtival, all the Banks and Stoppages of the River, on this ≈øide the <hi>Cairo,</hi> which were before kept ≈øhut, and guarded by armed men, that ≈øuch as need the water for their grounds might not open them, are cut and removed, and the water let into the Country. By this means the River ≈øpreads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad more than before, and its water returns <pb n="34" facs="tcp:106091:21"/>not back, which makes them ≈øay, that it ri≈øeth and ≈øwells no more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becau≈øe the day after the <hi>Holy Cro≈øs,</hi> they do not take notice of its increa≈øe at the Pillar of <hi>Mikias,</hi> nor publi≈øh it about the Town, as before; they believe therefore that this is done, becau≈øe the River never increa≈øeth after.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becau≈øe when the ≈øea≈øons of the year in
<hi>Egypt</hi> are regular, the winds <hi>Mae≈øtrals</hi> that help to make the River ≈øwell, cea≈øe after the 17th of <hi>September,</hi> and the Southerly winds ri≈øe, driving the waters out of the Fields.</p>
                  <p>Though the≈øe rea≈øons appear ≈øtrong enough, to prove the Opinion of the <hi>Copties,</hi> one cannot without offending them ≈øay, that the River may yet increa≈øe after that day, becau≈øe the winds
<hi>Mae≈øtrals,</hi> and the rains of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> may ≈øome years continue a longer time than ordinary, and ≈øo the River may increa≈øe a little, not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: for the≈øe winds have blown till the Month of
<hi>November.</hi> In the year 1672. at the <hi>Calliz</hi> of <hi>Cairo</hi> it was vi≈øible, that the water was ri≈øen three fingers higher than the day before, in the night of the Exaltation of the <hi>Holy Cro≈øs.</hi> It may be ≈øaid, that this increa≈øe was not real, but only cau≈øed by ≈øome ≈øtoppage at the pa≈ø≈øage of the River, or at one of the Bridges of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel out of the City: For my part, let every one believe what ≈øeems mo≈øt likely.</p>
                  <p>From hence we may ≈øee how much ≈øome Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers have been mi≈øtaken, when they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to per≈øwade us, that the River
<hi>Nilus</hi> never increa≈øeth above 40 days: For if you reckon the beginning of its increa≈øe, from the <pb n="35" facs="tcp:106091:21"/>17th of <hi>June</hi> till the 14th of <hi>Septemb.</hi> the day of its decrea≈øe, you ≈øhall find that it increa≈øeth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring 100 days at lea≈øt.</p>
                  <p>There cannot be a greater Te≈øtimony of this, than the Cu≈øtom of the <hi>Copties,</hi> who in their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick have a form of prayer for the increa≈øe of the River, which they ≈øay from the 12th day of <hi>Baoni,</hi> or <hi>June,</hi> till the 8th of <hi>Babe,</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> which is in all 120 days. In which prayer they de≈øire, that God would cau≈øe the River to ri≈øe to its nece≈ø≈øary height, to water ≈øufficiently the Country, as <hi>Abulbaracat,</hi> a famous Author a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt the
<hi>Copties,</hi> ≈øaith in his work called <hi>Mo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah iddolme,</hi> which I have brought from <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> altogether ignorant, a≈øcribe this ordinary decrea≈øe to a Miracle. They ob≈øerve the Fe≈øtival of the Exaltation of the <hi>Holy Cro≈øs,</hi> at which time they ble≈øs a Cro≈øs at the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Ma≈øs,</hi> which they ca≈øt into
<hi>Nilus,</hi> and imagine that this Cro≈øs ≈øtops the increa≈øe of the River.</p>
                  <p>Their Patriarch was wont to perform this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony with great pomp and ≈øtate; but becau≈øe the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> ≈øuffer them not to go in Proce≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Cities publickly, their Prie≈øts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve this Cu≈øtom every one in his own Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.</p>
                  <p>The waters of this River have ≈øeveral Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 1. They cau≈øe a Loo≈øene≈øs to the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers, if they drink of them at their fir≈øt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, which continues about eight days. 2. They cau≈øe an itch in the skin, which troubles ≈øuch as drink of them when the River increa≈øes. This itch is very ≈ømall, and appears fir≈øt about the Arms, next upon the Stomach, and ≈øpreads all <pb n="36" facs="tcp:106091:22"/>about the Body, which cau≈øeth a grievous pain. This Itch comes not only upon ≈øuch as drink of the River, but ≈øuch as drink of the waters of the Ci≈øterns filled with the River water. It la≈øts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ≈øix Weeks. 3. About the Month of <hi>June, July, Augu≈øt,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> it turns into a ≈øwet, but is not ≈øo in any other time of the year. 4. When this water covers the Earth, it fats the Land with the ≈ølime that it leaves behind. Mon≈øieur <hi>Th.</hi> is mi≈øtaken in his Travels into the <hi>Levant,</hi> when he ≈øaith, that this ≈ølime makes the ground ≈øo fat, that if they did not mingle Sand with it, the ground would rot, and choak what is put into it; and that in <hi>Egypt</hi> they take as much pains to carry Sand into the ground, as we do to carry dung. This is not generally ≈øo; for they never u≈øe Sand, but for Melons, Cucumbers, and ≈øuch like Fruits, which grow only in ≈øandy ground; they never u≈øe Sand for other Fruits and Grains.</p>
                  <p>When the River runs over, it makes a great de≈øtruction; it carries away not only great pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Bank, but de≈øtroys ≈øometimes Towns and Villages near to it. This may ea≈øily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the ruines of the Hou≈øes, and the old Walls, ≈øeen all along the ≈øides of the River.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it alters its Channel. I have read in the
<hi>Mekkin,</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Hi≈øtorian, that about the time that the
<hi>Arabians</hi> conquer'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ≈øo high, as to touch the Walls of the <hi>Ca≈ø≈ør I≈ø≈øc√©mma,</hi> a part of the old <hi>Cairo;</hi> and that it ran near the Church of <hi>Mary Moncure,</hi> which is in that of the Patriarchs, in the Street called in that time
<hi>H√°ret il bahr,</hi> The Street of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; <pb n="37" facs="tcp:106091:22"/>whereas now it is above a mile off from this place.</p>
                  <p>One day as I was walking out of the old <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> in the Fields, near the Church of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> the <hi>Copties</hi> ≈øhewed me a Garden near adjoyning, which was about 10 years ago upon the Banks of the River, but at pre≈øent it is above a Musket ≈øhot off, becau≈øe the River hath taken as much ground on the other ≈øide, as it hath le≈øt on this.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ≈øee whether the Kings of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> are able to divert the cour≈øe of the River, and cau≈øe all the Inhabitants to peri≈øh with hunger, as ≈øome imagine. I am of this Opinion, though the Father <hi>Telles</hi> ≈øuppo≈øeth and alledgeth many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in his Hi≈øtory of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> The≈øe are the Rea≈øons that oblige me to believe it po≈ø≈øible.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Letter of <hi>David,</hi> King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ≈øir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Con≈øtantine,</hi> written to <hi>Abu ≈øeid Barc√∫k,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the year of the Martyrs, 1193. I have a Copy of it written in <hi>Arabick,</hi> in which he threatens him in two di≈øtinct places of his Letter, to turn a≈øide the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> and hinder it from entering into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to cau≈øe all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to peri≈øh with hunger, if he continues to vex the <hi>Copties,</hi> whom he names his Brethren. He ≈øaith, that he hath received from God this priviledge, which he had not di≈øcover'd to any of his Predece≈ø≈øors.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becau≈øe the Kings of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Current of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and turn'd it out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the days of <hi>Mo≈øtan≈øir,</hi> one of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffes</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> which obliged him to ≈øend the Patriarch of the <hi>Copties</hi> with rich Pre≈øents to the King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> to intreat him to take away
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106091:23"/>the Bank which he had rai≈øed to turn a≈øide the River. The King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> having granted him this reque≈øt for the Patriarchs ≈øake, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver increa≈øed in one night three Cubits, which was ≈øufficient to water the Fields with that water that was there before; as we may ≈øee in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory of the <hi>Mu≈øulmans</hi> of <hi>George le Mekkin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt thing that Strangers may take notice of in ≈øailing upon the River, is the great number of I≈ølands, whereof ≈øome be very great,
20 miles in compa≈øs: They proceed fir≈øt from the ≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of Ve≈ø≈øels that have ≈øtuck in the mud. This happens frequently through the unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the Mariners, and the mud of the River, the ≈ølowne≈øs of the Current, the dirt and mire gathers immediately about any thing that ≈øtops there; by this means the≈øe places increa≈øe into I≈ølands. Almo≈øt every day new I≈ølands are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable: And becau≈øe the State of
<hi>Egypt</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver chang'd ≈øince the Conque≈øt of Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> and that the≈øe I≈ølands have been made ≈øince, they are not recorded in the Rolls of the <hi>Divan</hi> of that time. From hence it is that they pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> but belong to the <hi>Pacha,</hi> who lets them out to the <hi>Ca≈øciefs</hi> of the Province, where the≈øe I≈ølands are ≈øcituated, or to whom he plea≈øeth.</p>
                  <p>Several Pillars have been erected in divers times to mea≈øure the ri≈øing of the River.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt was at <hi>Menuf,</hi> or <hi>Memphis,</hi> built by
<hi>Jo≈øeph Jacob≈øon.</hi> When this fell to ruine, a rich Lady of the
<hi>Copties,</hi> named <hi>Deluca,</hi> erected two others; one at
<hi>In≈øine,</hi> or <hi>Thebe,</hi> and the other at <hi>Achmin.</hi> When this la≈øt decayed, the <hi>Greeks</hi> built one at <hi>Ca≈ø≈ør I≈ø≈øcemma,</hi> whereof the Ruines are yet to be ≈øeen, as ≈øome ≈øay.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106091:23"/>
                  <p>Ater that <hi>Amru ibn il A≈ø≈ø</hi> had conquered
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> he cau≈øed one to be built at <hi>In≈øine</hi> for the ≈øame purpo≈øe.

                  <p>The la≈øt of the≈øe Pillars ≈øtands in the <hi>Roude,</hi> an I≈øland, where it remains to this very day. It was erected by the Command of

                  <p>When Chri≈øtianity flouri≈øh'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to one of their Prie≈øts to examine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe of the River; which action was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three hours after midnight, and after Ma≈øs.

As ≈øoon as the Lead touches the top of the water, they tye the ≈øtring, and ≈øtop the Well, ≈øealing it with their Seal: Afterwards they go to the Church, and continue there till the morning, at which time they examine how much the water is ri≈øen that night, for at break of day they take away the Seal, they open the Well, and draw up the Cord. Now by the ri≈øing of the water in the Well, and the number of the knots that are wet, they can Progno≈øticate how many Cubits the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will ri≈øe that year above ≈øixteen. They reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Cubit for every knot that is wet: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if there be four knots wet, they under≈øtand that the River will ri≈øe four Cubits that year, that is in all twenty; ≈øo they judge of the re≈øt.</p>
                  <p>Neverthele≈øs, I know not whether this be true, or whether it be but a Cheat, as the late holy <hi>Greek</hi> at <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> of

                  <head>Of the <hi>Crocodile.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Crocodile,</hi> in <hi>Arabick</hi> called
<hi>Tim≈ø√°h,</hi> is the mo≈øt remarkable and mo≈øt curious Animal belonging to the River <hi>Nilus.</hi> I have therefore thought that it de≈øerv'd a particular De≈øcription among≈øt the Fi≈øhes of this Current. That it might be the more punctual and exact, I ≈øhall fir≈øt repeat what
<hi>Pliny</hi> ≈øaith, and afterwards add what I have taken notice of. This Learned <pb n="45" facs="tcp:106091:26"/>Naturali≈øt tells us that <hi>The Crocodile is an Animal with four Legs that makes a grievous de≈øtruction both in the Water, and out upon the Land. Of all the Creatures that live upon the Earth, this alone is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Tongue, and this alone moves the upper-jaw in eating. It hath two ranks of great Teeth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is longer than</hi> 18
<hi>Cubits. It produceth Eggs about the bigne≈øs of a Goo≈øe-Egg, that it ≈øits upon them out of the Water, and lays them at the place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the Water is to ri≈øe that Year, when it is at its highe≈øt; as if it had a knowledge of this before-hand. It is the only Creature that ri≈øeth from ≈øuch a ≈ømall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to ≈øuch a prodigious bigne≈øs. It is Armed with Claws to defend it ≈øelf. Its Skin on the Back is ≈øo extraordinary hard that no Weapon, never ≈øo ≈øharp, is able to enter it. In the Day-time it lies upon the Ground, and ≈øpends the Nights in the Waters. When its Belly is very full, it ≈øleeps upon the Bank with its Mouth open; then there comes a little Bird, named</hi> Trochilos, <hi>To eat the remains of the devoured Prey which ≈øticks between the Teeth: with this Food it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhes it ≈øelf, and by the picking of the Teeth it gives the</hi> Crocodile <hi>a plea≈øure, which cau≈øeth him to fall a≈øleep in this po≈øture. At that time the</hi> Ichneumon <hi>takes notice of the</hi> Crocodile <hi>at a di≈øtance, and when it ≈øees its time it enters into the others Mouth, ≈ølides down the Throat into the Belly, and gnaws the Entrails; with this the</hi> Crocodile <hi>dies. In the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Nilus <hi>are al≈øo,</hi> as he ≈øaith, Dolphins <hi>which have a very ≈øharp Back, with which they kill the</hi> Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles <hi>that pur≈øue them continually. For that purpo≈øe the≈øe</hi> Dolphins <hi>≈øeem to be afraid of the ravenous Bea≈øt, which cau≈øeth them to hide them≈øelves in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters under the</hi> Crocodiles; <hi>then, with their ≈øharp backs, they rip open the others belly. This Creature,</hi> 
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:106091:27"/>≈øaith he, <hi>is very bold and daring to them that run from it, but timerous and fearful if it be pur≈øued. It is very weak-≈øighted in the Water, but out of the Water it is quick. In the Winter it ≈øpends four Months in ≈øome Cave, without eating. It lives long, and grows continually till it dies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the account that <hi>Pliny</hi> gives of the
<hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile.</hi> We will a little examine what he ≈øaith, and to that we ≈øhall add our own ob≈øervations.</p>
                  <p>It is true that the <hi>Crocodile</hi> is a very dreadful Creature in <hi>Egypt,</hi> becau≈øe of the great de≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that it makes in the Water, and out; for it devours not only all the Fi≈øh that it can catch in the River, but al≈øo the Camels, the Hor≈øes, the Sheep, the wild Beeves, the Dogs, and little Children. In ≈øhort, all that it can catch upon the Land, it draws into the River, and eats it.</p>
                  <p>Concerning its length, which <hi>Pliny</hi> ≈øaith is commonly above 18 Cubits, I mu≈øt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs that I know not how many Inches are his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; for, many Hunters of <hi>Crocodiles</hi> have a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured me that it grows never above a Cubit in length in a Year; and when it comes to twelve years old it grows no more: ≈øo that, according to this account, the longe≈øt
<hi>Crocodile</hi> is not above 12 Cubits in length. If this be true, the
<hi>Arabian</hi> Author, whom <hi>Ibn Beitar</hi> mentions in his Book of Animals and Plants, is mi≈øtaken, when he ≈øaith, that there are ≈øome
<hi>Crocodiles</hi> that have their Tails 6 Cubits long, their Head two, and the re≈øt of their Body 8.</p>
                  <p>The Eggs that he lays, which are ≈øometimes in Number 30, never
100, as a certain Traveller affirms, are as big as the Eggs of Au≈øtriches;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106091:27"/>three-times bigger than Gee≈øe-Eggs. As ≈øoon as they are out of its Body, it carries them into ≈øome I≈øland of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and puts them into a hole made with its fore-feet, it covers them with Sand, and ≈ømooths the place where they lye that no Per≈øon might di≈øcover them. In this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it leaves them, till by a natural In≈øtinct it knows that the young are formed. It goes then and opens the hole and breaks the ≈øhell with its Mu≈øle for the young to creep out. As ≈øoon as they are in the Air, they run ≈øtrait to the River. And becau≈øe ≈øome of the≈øe Eggs are rotten, it is from this corruption that a certain <hi>Lizard,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the
<hi>Arabs, Varal,</hi> is ingendred. We ≈øhall ≈øpeak of this Serpent in the ≈øequel of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcour≈øe.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Pliny</hi> ≈øaith of the <hi>Trochilos</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a further inquiry; for one might ask an hundred years in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> what this Bird is, and yet none is able to give an account.
<hi>Beitar</hi> ≈øaith this of it, when the <hi>Crocodile</hi> is full with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured Prey, he goes out of the Water to ≈øleep in the Sun; and becau≈øe its Teeth are full of ≈ølime and filth, in which the Worms are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; a certain Bird, as little as a <hi>Teitavi,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters between his Jaws, eats up the ≈ølime, and the Worms, if there be any; and when the
<hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile</hi> feels that all is clean, he ≈øhuts his Mouth to eat the Bird al≈øo. But Nature hath provided an expedient to ≈øecure it; there are two ≈øharp pricks on the top of the Birds Head, which when the
<hi>Crocodile</hi> feels, he opens his Jaws again for the Bird to e≈øcape out.</p>
                  <p>I inquired from ≈øeveral <hi>Moors,</hi> whether they knew any Bird that had any pricks on the Head? <pb n="48" facs="tcp:106091:28"/>They an≈øwered, they knew none. They told me, that there is in <hi>Egypt</hi> the <hi>Saksak,</hi> a Bird that keeps the <hi>Crocodile</hi> always company, which I have ≈øeen very often, and which lives upon the filth that ≈øticks about, and between, the
<hi>Crocodile</hi>'s Teeth. Whether therefore the <hi>Saksak</hi> of the
<hi>Moors,</hi> and the Bird mentioned by <hi>Beitar,</hi> be the
<hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilos</hi> of <hi>Pliny,</hi> I leave to the Reader to judge.</p>
                  <p>Concernining the <hi>Ichneumon,</hi> named by the <hi>Arabians, Nims,</hi> by the <hi>Italians, Sorca di faraone,</hi> and by the
<hi>French-men, Rat d' Egypte.</hi> It is very true that it creeps into the Mouth of the <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile,</hi> enters into its Belly, which it gnaws to the very Entrails; the like happens to the Camels, and wild Beeves, and other Animals, when they ≈øleep in the Fields.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Pliny</hi> ≈øpeaks concerning the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins is not likely, for there be none in the River. But it may be it is the
<hi>Tir≈øe,</hi> which is the only Fi≈øh that a≈ø≈øaults the
<hi>Crocodile.</hi> This <hi>Tir≈øe</hi> is as round as a Buckler which eats the young <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles</hi> when it can meet them.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Crocodiles</hi> can live a long while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ≈øaith, is a truth which I have ≈øeen by experience by two that I have kept alive a long while. I had one in my Clo≈øet about a Foot long, and another ≈øix in my Cellar. I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the latter to be tied with a great Cord about the Jaws, that it might not offend ≈øuch as came to ≈øee it. They lived both about a Month without eating. The <hi>Moors</hi> told me that they could ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt forty days without any nouri≈øhment.</p>
                  <p>They have, in all, three-≈øcore and twelve great Teeth, very ≈øharp; ≈øix and thirty in the upper-jaw, and as many in the lower: So that
<hi>Ibn Beitar</hi> 
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:106091:28"/>is mi≈øtaken, when he ≈øaith in his Hi≈øtory of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which I have ≈øent to the King's Library, that they have three≈øcore in the upper-jaw, and forty in the lower; and that between every two ≈øharp and great Teeth, there is one ≈øquare and little one; for I have ≈øeen many alive and dead, but have never found this difference in the Teeth, but rather I have always found them to be ≈øharp and uniform.</p>
                  <p>Its four Paws are furni≈øhed with great Hooks, or Claws, very ≈øharp; the two Fore-feet having five di≈øtinct, ≈øeparated the one from the other; the two hinder but four, which are all joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a very thin skin, as are the Feet of all Sea-fowl, as Gee≈øe and Ducks.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabian</hi> Authors ≈øay, That it ca≈øts out its Excrements by the Throat, becau≈øe it hath no hole under the Tail, and its Stones have the ≈ømell of Musk; but as I have had no experience neither of one nor t'other, I refer my ≈øelf to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Becau≈øe the <hi>Crocodile</hi> cannot well turn it ≈øelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Belly when it lies upon the Back, and that it is needful that the Female be in that po≈øture when the Male covers her. The Male takes care when he hath laid her upon her Back and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his duty, to turn her again upon her Belly, for fear of the Hunters.</p>
                  <p>I have al≈øo taken notice, that from the City <hi>Cairo,</hi> towards the upper <hi>Egypt,</hi> there are many <hi>Crocodiles</hi> to be found, where they do much mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; but from thence towards the lower
<hi>Egypt</hi> are very few, and they ≈øay, that they be not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> give two Rea≈øons of this; they ≈øay,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106091:29"/>That one of their Saints, named <hi>Sidi Ibrahim il Zuphi,</hi> or <hi>The Lord Abraham of Zug,</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd them to hinder them from pa≈ø≈øing beyond the City <hi>Cairo,</hi> and bound them to hurt no body. The other Rea≈øon is, as they ≈øay, becau≈øe under the Pillar or
<hi>Mikias</hi> there is a <hi>Tali≈øman</hi> that kills them as ≈øoon as they draw near.</p>
                  <p>But it is mo≈øt certain that there are ≈øome on this ≈øide the <hi>Cairo</hi> to be ≈øeen, though not ≈øo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as on the other. This proceeds, as they ≈øay, from the <hi>Tali≈øman</hi> that is turn'd up-≈øide down in this Pillar, and therefore lo≈øeth its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt vertue; therefore they can pa≈øs beyond it, ≈øwimming upon their Backs.</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:106091:37"/>as far as <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> as they lye in order.</p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as we enter into the River, from the Sea, we find on the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide, at the Mouth, an old Ca≈øtle ruinated, but ≈ømall; which, as the <hi>Francs</hi> ≈øay, was built by S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, when he had <hi>Damietta.</hi> It is ≈øquare, and divided into four round Turrets, upon which ≈øome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery have been planted to command the Pa≈ø≈øage, and where a few <hi>Moors</hi> are upon the Guard.</p>
               <p>A little further into the River ≈øtands a poor Village, named

               <p>In this Village dwell the Owners of the <hi>Germes</hi> (being Long-Boats made to un-load Ships and draw them out of the Sands) that guide and tow along the Ships that ≈øail in or out of the River; and di≈øcover to them the Banks of Sand, which are very ordinary in this Road.</p>
               <p>In this Village is to be ≈øeen the Foundation of another ≈øquare Fort, the Walls whereof are not yet fini≈øh'd, and never likely to be. There are al≈øo here two <hi>Calitz,</hi> or Artificial Channels, full of the River-water all the year; made on purpo≈øe to water the Fields.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>DAmietta,</hi> called by the <hi>Arabians, Dami√°t,</hi> a famous City of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is ≈øcituate upon the
<hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> about eight Miles from the Mouth. Next to <hi>Cairo</hi> it is the greate≈øt, mo≈øt beautiful, the riche≈øt, the mo≈øt populous, and the fulle≈øt of Merchants of all <hi>Egypt;</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Trade draws thither a great number of People form all parts of <hi>Turkie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is built upon the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> in the form of an half Moon. The Waves of this River that wa≈øh the Foundations of their Hou≈øes on that ≈øide, and the great number of beautiful <hi>Mo≈øques,</hi> together with the Fleet of Ships and Barques that ride in the Haven, yield a mo≈øt delightful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect.</p>
                  <p>There are no Walls, nor Fortifications, only a round, and very high Tower, that ≈øtands at the end of the Town towards the Sea; where there is neither Watch nor Ward, nor Guns.</p>
                  <p>In this City there is great Trading in Linen, Rice, Coffee, and Stuffs. I was told, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year, about five hundred Ships go out of this Haven, ≈ømall and great, loaded with Rice for <hi>Turkie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are made many beautiful ≈øorts of Linen of all kinds and colours, which are Tran≈øport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Foreign Countries. Here is al≈øo a great deal of Fi≈øh ≈øalted. The <hi>Mullet</hi> that are here pickled are highly e≈øteem'd all over the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Town is Governd by an <hi>Aga,</hi> ≈øent thither from the
<hi>Pacha,</hi> and therefore nam'd by the <hi>Turks, <pb n="68" facs="tcp:106091:38"/>Pachaga≈øi,</hi> or the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Pacha.</hi> Be≈øides his other Incomes, he takes from every Tavern of <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae</hi> ten
<hi>Pora's,</hi> in the City are a great many ≈øuch Taverns. From every
<hi>Carache</hi> (it being a little Ship) he receives five <hi>Pora's;</hi> and from greater Ships ≈øix and thirty, and forty, when they go out of the Port: Be≈øides many Ca≈øualties which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a great deal, through his extortion, as the manner of the <hi>Turks</hi> is: for, out of our Ship he took ≈øix Barrels of <hi>Cyprus</hi>-wine, containing each ≈øix <hi>Metres,</hi> and every <hi>Metre</hi> holding twenty Pots, though this was not his due. I had ≈øome difficulty to ≈øave from his greedy hands a Box of excellent Wine of the Country of <hi>Ke≈ørovan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Souldiery, and chiefly the <hi>Jani≈ø≈øaries,</hi> are very in≈øolent. There be but two hundred, and about twenty
<hi>Spahins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the Chri≈øtians, the <hi>Grecks</hi> are the mo≈øt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous. They be about two hundred Families, and have a con≈øiderable Church.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Copties</hi> there be about eight Families. The
<hi>Turks,</hi> about a year ≈øince, took Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of their Church, becau≈øe they had not paid them a certain Tax that they had laid upon them.</p>
                  <p>There are no <hi>Francs</hi> that dwell there in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for want of Trade; becau≈øe this Haven is at a little di≈øtance from all the Chri≈øtian Countries, and becau≈øe they are ≈øettled at <hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> which lies more convenient for them, and nearer. There is only a Chamber which the <hi>Franci≈øcans</hi> of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land have hired in the Apartment of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Patriarch, which is a little Hou≈øe, very filthy, yet they Lodge there when they pa≈øs to and fro from <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> to
<hi>Cairo.</hi> The greate≈øt Traffick in this City, by Sea, is of Wood and Timber which <pb n="69" facs="tcp:106091:38"/>is Imported as well for Fewel as for the building of Hou≈øes and Ships; for Wood is very ≈øcarce in <hi>Egypt,</hi> chiefly in the Inferiour.</p>
                  <p>During my abode in this City I met with an old Ship-Captain, by Religion a <hi>Maronite,</hi> who told me, that between this City and the Town of <hi>Bogas,</hi> the River <hi>Nilus</hi> grew ≈øhallower every year; and that he had taken notice, that about fifteen years ago it was fifteen Cubits deep; but now ≈øcarce fifteen Foot. This proceeds from the Earth, which the Water loo≈øens from its ≈øides and wa≈øhes into the middle; about the Mouth of the River there the Earth ≈øtops. He gather'd from thence, that it was to be fear'd, that in this River great Ships would not be able, one day, to pa≈øs from the Mouth to <hi>Damietta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Town of <hi>Man≈øoura,</hi> i. e. <hi>Victorious,</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of the <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> of <hi>Dekahlie,</hi> is a great and beautiful Town, ≈øcituate upon the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus.</hi> Its Hou≈øes are not builded as tho≈øe of <hi>Damietta,</hi> upon the Water, but there is a large Street between them for to walk; but becau≈øe we Landed not then in that place, I had not the opportunity to view it, nor to give an exact De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription of it.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall only ≈øay this of it, That in this Town the
<hi>French</hi> King, S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> was taken Pri≈øoner by Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<hi>Saleh, negm iddin, eiiub ibn il Kamel.</hi> All the particulars of the end, and carrying on of this War, are to be ≈øeen in the <hi>Macrizi,</hi> and in
<hi>Ibn Zulak.</hi> I could wi≈øh the≈øe Hi≈øtories of the
<hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> were Tran≈ølated into any known Languages, for here are ≈øeveral remarkable Circum≈øtances mentioned in them, with which we are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. Here are likewi≈øe many Ver≈øes full <pb n="70" facs="tcp:106091:39"/>of Wit, but Satyrical, made then by the <hi>Moors,</hi> upon the taking of S.
<hi>Lewis,</hi> and the conclu≈øion of this War, ≈øo happy for their Nation.</p>
                  <p>Between <hi>Damietta</hi> and Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> are to be ≈øeen, upon the River ≈øide, a prodigious number of Pigeon-hou≈øes, which is here remarkable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there are not found ≈øo many in any other part of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> nor builded in the ≈øame manner.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe Pigeon-hou≈øes begin at <hi>Mitbedri,</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage near <hi>Man≈øoura,</hi> on the ≈øame ≈øide, in ≈øailing towards
<hi>Cairo.</hi> In one days Journey and a half I ≈øaw ≈øo many, that I wondred at it; for there is ≈øcarce a Hou≈øe in all the Villages but there is one, or more Pigeon-hou≈øes. At the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Walls are of Earth only, and round on the top, very ≈øpacious within, full of Earthen Pots for the Pigeons Ne≈øts; and without are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Poles for them to pitch on, and re≈øt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves. It is ea≈øie to judge whether the ≈øight, and Pro≈øpect of ≈øo many Pigeon-hou≈øes be not very delightful.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> that were in our Boat told us, that in the≈øe Villages fifteen Pigeons were commonly ≈øold for one <hi>Para;</hi> forty <hi>Para's</hi> make 4 <abbr>

<abbr>
                        <hi>d.</hi>
                     </abbr> So that I reckon, that about two hundred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Couples were ≈øold for that Money.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Semennut</hi> is a great Town, ≈øcituate on the
<hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> in the <hi>Ca≈øcieftik</hi> of
<hi>Garbie,</hi> not far from <hi>Mohelle Kab√≠re,</hi> or the great
<hi>Mohelle.</hi> It is built in a Triangular Form; the lower part ≈øtretches it ≈øelf along the River. The Barques that ≈øail towards <hi>Cairo</hi> are bound to ≈øtop here, and pay Cu≈øtome: The Cu≈øtome-hou≈øe is built upon a Ship, in the River, at which the Ve≈ø≈øels ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øtop above an hour.</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:106091:39"/>
                  <p>In the middle Way, between <hi>Diametta</hi> and <hi>Cairo,</hi> is <hi>Mitgamr,</hi> a very beautiful and large Town, ≈øcituate upon the
<hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus.</hi> We landed, and I found there many fair Hou≈øes, and a ≈øpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Bazar,</hi> or Market-place, where all manner of Provi≈øions were to be ≈øold. Here are al≈øo a great many Chri≈øtians of the <hi>Copties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Over again≈øt <hi>Mitgamr,</hi> that is on the
<hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide <hi>Nilus,</hi> is <hi>Sitfe,</hi> a beautiful and big Town, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to to the <hi>Ca≈øcieftik</hi> of <hi>Mohelle Keb√≠re;</hi> where we beheld a pur≈øuit of ≈øome Pea≈øants, whom the
<hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> of that Province chas'd. They were come to demand a certain Tribute, which he was wont to pay them: and upon his denial of it they ro≈øe up in Arms again≈øt him: But as ≈øoon as he had ≈øent out the
<hi>Spahins</hi> again≈øt them, they ran all away. The≈øe poor
<hi>Caitiffs</hi> being on Foot, and finding them≈øelves followed by Hor≈øe-men; that they might not fall into their hands, they ca≈øt them≈øelves, in ha≈øte, into the River to ≈øwim over; ≈øix were unhappily drown'd before our Eyes.</p>
                  <p>In the upper <hi>Egypt</hi> is a Village, named al≈øo
<hi>Sitfe;</hi> which I ≈øhall mention in another place.</p>
                  <p>The 12th of <hi>April,</hi> about two a-Clock in the Afternoon, we left one of the Branches of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> that leaves the main River and runs to <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etta,</hi> and entred into the <hi>Bogas,</hi> or Channel of
<hi>Boulac.</hi> The clear Weather gave me the liberty to take notice of the ≈øeparation of the two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the River: I found that the Branch that goes to <hi>Ro≈øetta</hi> ≈øtretches it ≈øelf to the <hi>North-Ea≈øt,</hi> and that of <hi>Diametta</hi> to the <hi>North.</hi> In re≈øpect of this la≈øt, <hi>Cairo</hi> ≈øtands to the <hi>South-Ea≈øt,</hi> and its Ca≈øtle to the <hi>South.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this <hi>Bogas</hi> the two great <hi>Pyramides</hi> of
<hi>Egypt</hi> 
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:106091:40"/>are fir≈øt di≈øcover'd: They appear here to be equal, though one is far higher than the other.</p>
                  <p>From this ≈øeparation, or divi≈øion of <hi>Nilus,</hi> as far as <hi>Boulac,</hi> there is but an hour and a halfs travelling, though Mon≈øieur <hi>Thevenot</hi> tells us of ≈øix Leagues.</p>
                  <p>We landed at <hi>Boulac,</hi> the <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> before
<hi>Ea≈øter,</hi> at Night. I ≈øtaid there till the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and entred into <hi>Cairo</hi> about Noon. At my entrance I paid a Crown, at the Cu≈øtome-hou≈øe of <hi>Boulac,</hi> which is an ordinary Tribute demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all <hi>Francs</hi> many years ago.</p>

                  <p>MY de≈øign at fir≈øt, was to publi≈øh a large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription of all the Rarities of this great and famous City, before I proceed on in my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: But ≈øince I have con≈øidered that great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes are wont to nau≈øeate, rather than to delight the Reader, chiefly in the≈øe days that Men are pleas'd with the reading of ≈øhort and ≈ømall Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes: I have therefore taken notice of tho≈øe things only which other Travellers have omitted, and could never know perfectly for want of an in≈øight into the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue.

                  <p>The City of <hi>Cairo</hi> borrows the Name from the Planet
<hi>Mars,</hi> called by the <hi>Arabians, Kaher;</hi> which Name was given to it, as ≈øaith the <hi>Serr√∫r,</hi> an <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Hi≈øtorian, becau≈øe the Foundation of its Walls were laid when this Planet was in its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcent; which hapned unhappily in this manner.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:106091:40"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Giauher,</hi> the General of <hi>Meez le d√≠n all√°,</hi> one of the <hi>Cailiffs</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> having re≈øolved to build a new City for the abode of his Lord, in the Year 362 of the <hi>Hegira;</hi> he gave orders to the A≈øtronomers, to ob≈øerve the time of the ri≈øing of a good Star, when the Foundation might be laid; that the City might be the more happy, and of a longer continuance.</p>
                  <p>The A≈øtronomers accordingly encompa≈ø≈øed about with Ropes, all that ≈øpace of Ground that was to be ≈øhut into the Walls; tying to the Ropes a great many little Bells, to give notice to the Builders when they were to ca≈øt the Foundation: The ≈øignal was, the ≈øounding of the Bells; which was to be given when they ≈øaw the ri≈øing of a good Star.</p>
                  <p>By chance it happen'd, that a Crow pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ropes that was ≈øtretch'd along, when <hi>Mars</hi> was in its ri≈øing; and with the motion of the Ropes cau≈øed the Bells to ≈øound: As ≈øoon as the Ma≈øons heard the ≈øignal given, they ca≈øt all, with one con≈øent, the Foundation: which when the A≈øtronomers had under≈øtood, they declar'd by unlucky ri≈øing of <hi>Mars,</hi> that govern'd at that In≈øtant, that the City ≈øhould be one day taken by a Conqueror that ≈øhould come out of
<hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> where <hi>Mars</hi> governs: Which hath proved true about five hundred and three≈øcore years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> came from <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Romania,</hi> and took not only the City, but the whole Country; and de≈øtroyed the Race of their Kings, by hanging the la≈øt.</p>
                  <p>Though they conceived that this Star would prove unlucky, they called the City neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs <hi>Kahera,</hi> or <hi>Cairo,</hi> as we name it in <hi>Europe:</hi> 
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:106091:41"/>which Name continues till this day. This City is become very rich, powerful, and great, by its Trade; in≈øomuch, that of all the Cities of the <hi>Levant,</hi> this alone hath de≈øerv'd the name of Great.</p>
                  <p>It is ≈øcituate in a Champain, very delightful, at the Foot of a Mountain of Sand, named in <hi>Arab. Gebel il mokattam,</hi> or the Mountain cut through, which ≈øtands on the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide, and incommodes the City; becau≈øe it deprives it of the benefit of the fre≈øh Winds that blow from thence. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath another inconveniency, it is far from the River.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing in the World more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than to take a pro≈øpect of it from ≈øome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place: for you might from thence view an infinite number of Hou≈øes, which, in≈øtead of Coverings, have Turrets; and ≈øee an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of <hi>Mo≈øques</hi> with their various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of differing Buildings intermingled, and ≈øurrounded with Palm-trees, and Gardens; all which together repre≈øents a mo≈øt beautiful Pro≈øpect.</p>
                  <p>It hath ≈øeven Gates. The Names are, 1. <hi>Bab zucile;</hi> 2.

                  <p>There is a Channel cut through this City, from the

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106091:41"/>
                     <hi>Arabian</hi> Hi≈øtorian, ≈øaith; That <hi>Tar≈øis ibn Malia,</hi> one of the <hi>Pharaoh's;</hi> and, as he believes, the King that took the Wife of <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> cau≈øed it fir≈øt to be cut. Since the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> conquer'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> and took it from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Heraclius,</hi> they have named it
<hi>Calitz Emir il Muminin,</hi> or <hi>The Channel of the Prince of the faithful,</hi> becau≈øe of <hi>Amru ibn Chottab,</hi> the ≈øecond
<hi>Califf</hi> after <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was the fir≈øt ≈øirnamed The Prince of the faithful, becau≈øe he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Amru ibn a≈ø≈ø</hi> to lead him as far as <hi>Colzim,</hi> a Town ≈øcituate near the

<hi>Abbas,</hi> cau≈øed it to be ≈øtopt on that ≈øide which is towards the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Now it is called <hi>Calitz il Hakemi,</hi> or the <hi>Calitz of Hakem;</hi> becau≈øe <hi>Hakem-be amr ille,</hi> another <hi>Califf</hi> of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> cau≈øed this Channel, which was decayed through the negligence of his Predece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øors, to be repaired. It is called al≈øo

                  </p>
                  <p>In my Relation of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Printed in <hi>Italian</hi> at
<hi>Paris,</hi> 1671. I ≈øaid that the <hi>Turks, Copties,</hi> and
<hi>Jews,</hi> open, in their turns, this Channel every Year: but I under≈øtand ≈øince, that this Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to the
<hi>Souba≈øchi</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> who ≈øtrikes the fir≈øt three, or four blows upon the Bank that hinders the River from entring into the Channel,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106091:42"/>afterwards all that will work have liberty granted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copies</hi> have but two Churches at <hi>Cairo;</hi> one in the Street named <hi>Haret Zuele,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the
<hi>Greek's</hi> Street. The fir≈øt is Dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was built by a renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Phy≈øician, named <hi>Zabulon.</hi> He lived about two-hundred-≈øeventy years before the <hi>Arabians</hi> became Ma≈øters of <hi>Egypt.</hi> He is yet famous for his wonderful Riches. They ≈øay that he hid them in a Well which is in the ≈øame Church, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd them with a
<hi>Tali≈øman,</hi> that none might have them after his decea≈øe. The Patriarch of the <hi>Copties</hi> Hou≈øe is joining to this Church.</p>
                  <p>The other in the <hi>Greek's</hi> Street is Dedicated to S.
<hi>Barba.</hi> It is but ≈ømall, and ob≈øcure. I went to ≈øee it the 4th of
<hi>November</hi> 1672.</p>
                  <p>Heretofore they had many Churches, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na≈øteries; and a Bi≈øhop in the <hi>Chandak,</hi> an old Suburb of <hi>Cairo,</hi> but now ruinated. But now they have but two; one Dedicated to the Arch-Angel
<hi>Gabriel;</hi> the other to the Abbot <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> ≈øirnamed
<hi>Roes.</hi> Here the <hi>Copties of Cairo</hi> have a Burying-place.</p>
                  <p>Of the many <hi>Mo≈øques</hi> at <hi>Cairo,</hi> that which is called <hi>Giama ill a≈ø≈øar</hi> is the riche≈øt, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt. It was built by <hi>Giauher,</hi> the fir≈øt Founder of the City: It is yet the Cathedral, where the four <hi>Mouftis,</hi> or Doctors of the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide. It is a Refuge for Offenders, and a School for to teach the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> with its Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues it entertains no le≈øs than eight hundred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of that Profe≈ø≈øion; and receives for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe two thou≈øand <hi>Ardebs</hi> of Corn, from the Store-hou≈øes of the Grand <hi>Seignior;</hi> and ≈øeven <pb n="77" facs="tcp:106091:42"/>thou≈øand more from other Benefactors.</p>
                  <p>There are four <hi>Mouftis</hi> at <hi>Cairo</hi> that borrow their Names from the four chief Sects of <hi>Mahe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met:</hi> 1. Of
<hi>Sciaffe√≠</hi> 2. Of <hi>Maleki;</hi> 3. Of <hi>Hambali;</hi> 4. Of
<hi>Hanefi.</hi> They are all equal in Dignity, becau≈øe their Sects, whereof they are the chief, are likewi≈øe equal.</p>
                  <p>They have power to excommunicate the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha's</hi> when they attempt to do any thing again≈øt their Religion, or their <hi>Mo≈øques.</hi> For In≈øtance, they excommunicated <hi>Pacha Ibrahim</hi> in the year 1672, becau≈øe he offered to take away ≈øome of the Gifts, and Rents, belonging to the <hi>Mo≈øques</hi> of <hi>Cairo:</hi> By that means they hinder'd him from executing his ≈øacrilegious de≈øign. When the Excommunication prevails not, they ≈øhut the Gates of this <hi>Mo≈øque,</hi> which cau≈øes the People to ri≈øe up in Arms; and they never are quiet, till they have kill'd the Offender.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Cairo,</hi> and in its Suburbs, there are nine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Shambles belonging to the Grand <hi>Seignior:</hi> 1. That of
<hi>Ha≈ø≈øen√≠e,</hi> which is the greate≈øt: 2. That of <hi>Haret Jeh√∫d,</hi> or of <hi>the Street of the Jews:</hi> 3. That of <hi>Bab illuk,</hi> or of <hi>the Whore's Quarter:</hi> 4. That of <hi>the Lions Bridge:</hi> 5. That of old <hi>Cairo:</hi> 6. That of <hi>G√≠ze:</hi> 7. That of <hi>Haret il ≈øakkain:</hi> 8. That of <hi>Telun:</hi> 9. Two that are at <hi>Boulac;</hi> whereof, in one the Oxen are killed; in the other, the Sheep and Goats.</p>
                  <p>The Heads, and the Skins of all the Bea≈øts that are kill'd in the≈øe Markets, unle≈øs it be of the Goats, belong to the Grand
<hi>Seignior:</hi> out of this Cu≈øtome he receives a great profit.</p>
                  <p>It is very true, that in <hi>Cairo</hi> are ≈øeven differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Orders of the Militia. Among≈øt the≈øe, the <pb n="78" facs="tcp:106091:43"/>Montro≈ø≈øes, and Gunners, are not reckon'd; but only the

<hi>Memphis</hi> ≈øtood, next to New <hi>Cairo.</hi> It was heretofore a ≈øtately City, but now it is almo≈øt all ruinated.</p>
                  <p>In the 18th year of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> which is about 1033 years ≈øince that <hi>Amru ibn il a≈ø≈ø,</hi> General of <hi>Amru ibn Chottab,</hi> a ≈øucce≈ø≈øor of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> took this City. <hi>John Mekaukes,</hi> a noble <hi>Coptie,</hi> was then Governour for the Emperour
<hi>Heraclius.</hi> When <hi>Amru</hi> had taken it, he made Peace with
<hi>Mekaukes,</hi> upon condition that every <hi>Coptie</hi> ≈øhould pay him, and all his Succe≈ø≈øors, two-pence a-year as a Tribute; and that he ≈øhould give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for three days, to all the <hi>Arabians</hi> that

                  </p>
                  <p>This City hath been increas'd many times, as the Conquerors, and Lords of the Country, did think convenient to pitch upon a more plea≈øant place for their abode.</p>
                  <p>The places where the <hi>Fo≈øtat,</hi> the <hi>Ca≈ø≈ør i≈øc√©mma,</hi> the Quarter of the Patriarch of the <hi>Copties, Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Cateia,</hi> the <hi>Caraff,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fo≈øtat</hi> is a <hi>Greek</hi> Name, which ≈øignifies a Tent of Goat-skins. The <hi>Arabians</hi> name one ≈øide of Old <hi>Cairo</hi> thus, becau≈øe the Tent of <hi>Amru ibn il a≈ø≈ø,</hi> of this ≈øub≈øtance, was planted there when he was bu≈øie in Conquering
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ≈øame <hi>Amru</hi> cau≈øed it to be inclo≈øed in with Walls; after that he had taken the City of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> he ≈øettled there his abode, and that of his Succe≈ø≈øors: <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that had been the Royal City of the <hi>Greeks</hi> for about nine hundred years, was then for≈øaken; and the <hi>Fo≈øtat</hi> was the chief City of

                  </p>
                  <p>But when this Race was extinct, and Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> being built by <hi>Giauher,</hi> as we have ≈øaid, the <hi>Califfs</hi> cho≈øe it for their abode, cau≈øing <hi>Fo≈øtat</hi> to be burnt, that the new City might be ≈øtronger, and fuller of People; and they left <hi>Cateia,</hi> as we may ≈øee in <hi>Macrizi.</hi>

                     <hi>Ca≈ø≈ør I≈ø≈øc√©mma,</hi> is a Ca≈øtle, or Suburb, inclo≈øed with Walls, near adjoining to <hi>Fo≈øtat,</hi> built by
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> King of <hi>Per≈øia.</hi> Now only Chri≈øtians inhabit there. They have many Churches which we ≈øhall de≈øcribe in this following Journal; for I <pb n="80" facs="tcp:106091:44"/>went to ≈øee them on the 18th day of
<hi>July,</hi> 1672.</p>
                  <p>There are two differing Opinions concerning the Origine of this Name. Some would have it written, <hi>Ca≈ø≈ør iggiama;</hi> that is, the Ca≈øtle of the A≈ø≈øembly: for they ≈øay, that here the great Wits did meet to increa≈øe Learning; but this Opinion is not well grounded. Others write it
<hi>Ca≈ø≈ør i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øc√©mma;</hi> this is likely to be the true≈øt; for I find it thus written by all <hi>Arabian</hi> Hi≈øtorians.</p>
                  <p>The Granaries and Store-hou≈øes, of the Grand
<hi>Seignior,</hi> are adjoining to this Ca≈øtle. They are named by the
<hi>Arabs, Sci√≥ne.</hi> The Provi≈øions of Corn, and other nece≈ø≈øaries for the Food of the Malitia, are here kept; not only for the Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but al≈øo for all the other Countries that depend upon <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that this Corn might be better di≈øtributed, there are four
<hi>Aga's,</hi> or Officers, named in <hi>Arab. Agavat beta il ghel√†l,</hi> or <hi>Aga's of the Stores</hi> in the upper
<hi>Egypt:</hi> One dwells at <hi>Bene≈øuef,</hi> another at <hi>Minie,</hi> the third at <hi>Momfallat,</hi> the fourth at <hi>Girge.</hi> Their Office is, to gather up the Provi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Corn, and to ≈øend them to the <hi>Emin il Sci√≥ne,</hi> the Ma≈øter of the Store-hou≈øes of the Grand

                  <head>The way of Hatching Chickens at <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The 21≈øt of this Month I went to ≈øee the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens where the Chickens are hatched. The≈øe Ovens are builded in the ≈øame manner as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of <hi>France,</hi> made to bake Bread, only with this difference; they are not ≈øo high, nor ≈øo big as ours, nor of burnt Brick, but of Brick dried in the Sun. They have al≈øo, on the top, a round hole, as big as the circumference of a <hi>French</hi> Hat, through which the heat mounts up and goes out, which Ovens for Bread have not.</p>
                  <p>In the Hou≈øe where I ≈øaw them, they were plac'd in this manner. There were four and twenty: twelve on the right hand, and twelve on the left; ≈øix one upon another. At the fir≈øt ≈øight one would have thought them to be ≈øo many Sleeping-cells of Monks: but the Alley that was between
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106091:45"/>was ≈øo narrow, that when I enter'd in, the ≈ømoak and heat that came out had almo≈øt ≈øtifled me.</p>
                  <p>Now, to cau≈øe the Egs to be hatch'd, they put them all in the lowermo≈øt Ovens; and in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permo≈øt they kindle a ≈ømall Fire, for eight days, with Straw. Afterwards they ≈øtop them, and leave them ≈øo ≈øix other days: Then they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Egs from the lowermo≈øt Ovens, and ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the good from the bad, by examining them in the Sun-≈øhine. Afterwards they ca≈øt away the addled, and put all the good in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt Ovens; making, with Straw, a ≈ømall Fire in the lowermo≈øt, for two days. They leave them in that condition one and twenty days, without medling with them: at which time the Chickens begin to break the Shell; ≈øo that in two and twenty days they bring forth Chickens in this manner.</p>
                  <p>This is not to be practis'd, but during four Months in the Year; namely, from the Month of <hi>December,</hi> till the Month of <hi>April:</hi> The other part of the Year is not fit for this purpo≈øe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of the exce≈ø≈øive heats.</p>

                  <head>Of the <hi>Pyramides.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN my fir≈øt Voyage to <hi>Egypt</hi> I had ≈øeen the
<hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramides;</hi> but, having another opportunity offer'd to me, I went thither to view again the≈øe rare Monuments of Antiquity, to ≈øee whether I might not ob≈øerve ≈øomething more than I have taken notice of in my fir≈øt Relation.</p>
                  <p>On the 27th of <hi>April</hi> I went thither, in the Company of the <hi>French</hi> Con≈øul, and many other <pb n="84" facs="tcp:106091:46"/>Merchants, and with almo≈øt all his Hou≈øhold: we had with us three <hi>Jani≈ø≈øaries</hi> to guard us, ≈øo that we were in all about fifty Cavaliers, well mounted upon A≈ø≈øes; taking with us Provi≈øions ≈øufficient for three days.</p>
                  <p>When we were come to the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> and had ob≈øerv'd exactly every thing: I took notice that the place where they ≈øtood was a Burying-place. This is plain to any that ≈øee the place; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs it was the burying-place of the old City <hi>Memphis;</hi> for all the
<hi>Arabian</hi> Hi≈øtories inform us, that this City ≈øtood where the
<hi>Pyramides</hi> now are, over again≈øt Old <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I took notice that all the <hi>Pyramides</hi> have an entrance that leads to a low Alley, which is very long; and at the end is a Chamber, where the ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> did place the Bodies of tho≈øe Per≈øons, for whom the <hi>Pyramides</hi> was built. This entrance is not to be ≈øeen in every one of the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> becau≈øe the Wind hath ≈øtopt them with Sand. I ≈øaw upon ≈øome of them ≈øome
<hi>Hierogliphick</hi> Characters, but I had not time to write them out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I took notice that all the <hi>Pyramides</hi> were builded in very good order; and that each of the three greate≈øt were at the head of ten le≈ø≈øer, which are not well to be di≈øtingui≈øhed, becau≈øe of the heaps of Sand: one may yet imagine, to ≈øee the place, that in former Ages there have been here one hundred <hi>Pyramides,</hi> little and great.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I took notice that they are all builded upon an even Rock, covered over with white Sand; ≈øo that it is very probable that the Stones have been taken from the place, and not brought from <pb n="85" facs="tcp:106091:46"/>far, as ≈øome Travellers imagine, and old Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: for the greate≈øt is nothing but a Rock cut as a <hi>Pyramide,</hi> and covered over with a Wall of Stone.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I took notice that of all the Stones of the greate≈øt, there is ≈øcarce one entire, but either worn out with the Weather and Time, or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ≈øome other Accident; ≈øo that, though one may a≈øcend on all ≈øides to the top, yet not in all places with the ≈øame ea≈øe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I have taken notice that none of the
<hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides</hi> are alike, or perfectly ≈øquare; but that all have two ≈øides longer than the others. I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mea≈øure the greate≈øt: for that purpo≈øe I had with me a String of about thirty Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards; but becau≈øe the Winds have heap'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it Mountains of Sand, I could not po≈ø≈øibly draw a Line ≈øtrait from one Angle to the other.</p>
                  <p>On the 28th day of <hi>December</hi> I went to ≈øee the
<hi>Pyramides</hi> the third time, with ≈øome ≈øtrangers. In our way we were mightily troubled with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thick Mi≈øt, which la≈øted till ten a Clock in the Morning; and we found a great deal of Mud in the Trenches and Ditches, which was not yet dry ≈øince the retreat of the River; ≈øo that we were carried over upon the <hi>Moors</hi> backs that were with us.</p>
                  <p>At this time I went up to the top of the great
<hi>Pyramide;</hi> and I ob≈øerv'd, as at the fir≈øt, that the place where the <hi>Pyramides</hi> ≈øtand, is a pure Rock, cover'd over with white Sand; which appears ≈øufficiently by the Ditches and Caves round about the
<hi>Pyramides</hi> cut in the Rock.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Rock is to be ≈øeen, upon which ≈øtands the greate≈øt <hi>Pyramide,</hi> by a hole at one of the <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106091:47"/>Angles, between the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> and the <hi>North</hi> ≈øides.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Pyramides</hi> are not builded with Marble, as ≈øome ≈øay; but with a white ≈øandy Stone, very hard.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The greate≈øt hath but two hundred and ≈øix ≈øteps; and though Mon≈øieur <hi>Th.</hi> ≈øaith that it hath two hundred and eight, this proceeds from his not taking notice that two ≈øteps are broken into four.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. On the top of the greate≈øt <hi>Pyramide</hi> there was anciently a Statue, or <hi>Colo≈ø≈øe.</hi> This appears, becau≈øe it is not ≈øharp as the others, but plain: And there are yet to be ≈øeen great Pits, which were to keep fa≈øt the <hi>Colo≈ø≈øe</hi> from falling.</p>
                  <p>At pre≈øent there is nothing on the top but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Letters of the Names of Per≈øons or all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who have left them to witne≈øs that they had been there. There is no ≈øign of the Play at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala,</hi> which a <hi>Coptie</hi> told me was there imprinted in the days of the
<hi>Pharaoh's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Stones of the bigge≈øt <hi>Pyramide</hi> are not equal; for ≈øome of the undermo≈øt are four Foot high, ≈øome three Foot and an half, and five Foot long. The Stones of the middle are three Foot and five Inches high, and the uppermo≈øt Stones are but two Foot high, and three and an half long.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ≈øides of the <hi>Pyramides</hi> are not equal; for in the greate≈øt it is vi≈øible, and ≈øo in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the
<hi>North</hi>-≈øide is longer than that which ≈øtretches from
<hi>Ea≈øt</hi> to <hi>We≈øt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. In all the <hi>Pyramides</hi> there are very deep Wells cut in the Rock, ≈øquare; as I have ≈øeen in more than ten.</p>
                  <p>On the 26th day of <hi>June</hi> I went the fourth time
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106091:47"/>to ≈øee the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> in the Company of Mon≈øieur <hi>Sabatery,</hi> Vice-Con≈øul of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Pa≈ø≈øage to Old <hi>Cairo,</hi> on the other ≈øide of the River, I took notice of one thing very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in its Channel: The Water was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly green, as a Cake covered over with green Gra≈øs. This was the fir≈øt time that I ≈øaw it of this colour; which cau≈øed me to ask of the Boat-men, what this green colour was? They told me, tint the River
<hi>Nilus</hi> did then putrifie, that it had continued ≈øo fifteen days, and would be ≈øo five more. Some of them ≈øaid, that there was none could remember to have ≈øeen the River ≈øo green as that year, 1672.</p>
                  <p>To return again to the <hi>Pyramides:</hi> I went up this time to the top of the highe≈øt <hi>Pyramide:</hi> I enter'd into the Chamber, but ≈øaw no new thing which could cau≈øe me either to change, or add to my former Ob≈øervations. It is needle≈øs to ≈øpeak of its Dimen≈øions, ≈øeeing ≈øo many Travellers have already publi≈øh'd them, as Mon≈øieur <hi>Thevenot</hi> in his <hi>Levant</hi> Travels.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Pyramides</hi> we went to take a view of the Caves that are adjoining. There are many, all cut in the ≈øide of a Rock: Their out-≈øides are out of order, without any proportion; but their in-≈øide very equal, and polli≈øh'd. In every one there is a deep Well ≈øquare, cut in the Rock, where the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did put the Body of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, for whom the Cave was made; for it was their Sepulchre. The walls of many of the≈øe Caves are full of Hieroglyphick Figures, carved in the Rock. In ≈øome they are but ≈ømall, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers very lively. In one I number'd ≈øixteen great Figures, that repre≈øented eight Men and eight <pb n="88" facs="tcp:106091:48"/>Women, holding one another by the hands; with many other ≈ømall Figures, or Shapes, on both ≈øides.</p>

                  <p>WE ≈øaw next the <hi>Sphinx,</hi> near the <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides,</hi> on the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide. On the top ≈øtands the Head of a Woman of an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bigne≈øs and height. The <hi>Arabians</hi> call it

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> ≈øaith that it was the Tomb of King
<hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis.</hi> I imagine that this <hi>Sphinx</hi> was a Sepulchre, but we cannot under≈øtand that it belong'd to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis;</hi> for all the Records and Traditions of this <hi>Sphinx</hi> are lo≈øt.</p>
                  <p>That it is a Tomb may appear, Fir≈øt by its ≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, which is in a place which was in former Ages a Burying-place; and near the
<hi>Pyramides,</hi> and mortuary Caves. Secondly it is to be imagined that it was a Sepulchre from its building. In the hinder part is a Cave under ground, of a bigne≈øs an≈øwerable to that of the Head, into which I have look'd by an entrance that leads into it; ≈øo that it could ≈øerve to no other purpo≈øe but to keep a dead Corps.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Francs</hi> have, out of an exce≈øs of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity, climb'd up by the means of Rope-Ladders, to ≈øee whether this Head was hollow, or ma≈ø≈øie; and they have found it to be hollow, but filled at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent with Sand.</p>
                  <p>The Neck is worn out round about, which cau≈øeth Men to imagine that it will not be able to ≈øupport the weight of that great Head.</p>

                  <head>Of the Wells where the <hi>Mommies</hi> are.</head>
                  <p>WHen we had fully viewed this <hi>Sphinx,</hi> we took the Road that leads to <hi>Sacc√°ra,</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, at four hours travelling from the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> and about eight from <hi>Cairo</hi> towards the
<hi>South.</hi> The Burying-place of the <hi>Mommies</hi> is near adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Village.</p>
                  <p>And becau≈øe it was very late, and that we were to agree with the <hi>Arabians</hi> of the Village about the Price, the Number and Quality of the Wells that they were to open for us. We ≈øtopt there all Night, and the next Morning we took with us twelve Hor≈øe-men, to Guard us, of the
<hi>Arabians;</hi> with them we went to this Burying-place, where the
<hi>Mommies</hi> are in Caves under ground.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt Well that we ≈øaw was that of Birds Embalmed. When we had cau≈øed the Sand that ≈øtops the Wells Mouth to be removed, through which we were to go down, and from thence to enter into the Cave; we cau≈øed our ≈øelves to be let down one after another, by tying a double Rope about our middles. As ≈øoon as we were at the bottom, and that every one had lighted his Taper, and ≈øeveral Matches that we had brought, we went into the Cave creeping upon our Bellies. The Cave is an Alley in the Rock, about the height of a Man, and about the breadth of a Perch; and of an extraordinary length. We found there many other Alleys on both hands, cut in the Rock; where were many large ≈øtores, full of Earthen Pots, covered over with Coverings of the ≈øame ≈øub≈øtance. In the≈øe Pots were Embalmed Birds <pb n="90" facs="tcp:106091:49"/>of all kinds, every Bird in its own Pot. And as I thought that the remembrance of a Cu≈øtom ≈øo ancient, and ≈øuper≈øtitious, was worthy of our notice, I brought about half a dozen with me; ≈øome I have ≈øent to the King's Library. We found al≈øo ≈øome Hens Egs, empty, but entire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ill ≈ømell or crack.</p>
                  <p>When we had viewed ≈øufficiently this Cave, we returned up in the ≈øame manner that we went down, and found another open'd, called the Virgin; which is, that was never open'd before: According to our orders to the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur <hi>Tiger</hi> and the others went down in the ≈øame manner as into the former; I alone could not follow them, becau≈øe of a
<hi>Quartain</hi> Fever which had troubled me fourteen months, and took me at that very Moment: But I lo≈øt nothing by that: for the≈øe Gentlemen told me at their return, that they found an horrid ≈øtench, and a clo≈øe air, that put out their Candles, and their Matches al≈øo, every time that they endeavour'd to light them; which cau≈øed them to get up again without entring further. They told me that this Well was much deeper than the former.</p>
                  <p>We cau≈øed another to be open'd, which was not a Virgin Well, as the former, becau≈øe it was not ≈øo deep. I ventur'd into that, notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my indi≈øpo≈øition.</p>
                  <p>We found there two <hi>Mommies,</hi> a great one, and a little one of a Child, both in Coffins, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt was of Marble; upon the Covering it had the likene≈øs of the Per≈øon for whom it was made: We caus'd the≈øe Biers, or Coffins, to be open'd, but found nothing extraordinary; therefore we made no account of them, and left them where we found them.</p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:106091:49"/>
                  <p>We went down next into a Cave, called <hi>The Church,</hi> which was not ≈øo deep as the former. It was nothing but a long Alley under ground, well Plai≈øter'd, and Painted all over with Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Figures round about the ≈øides. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt all full of Sand, which cau≈øed us to creep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long upon our Knees.</p>
                  <p>If the Reader de≈øires a Pro≈øpect, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription of this ancient Burying-place, let him think upon a boundle≈øs Champain, even and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with Sand; where neither Trees, nor Gra≈øs, nor Hou≈øes, nor any ≈øuch thing is to be ≈øeen: Let him repre≈øent to him≈øelf the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this large Field full of dry Bones of Arms, Legs, Feet, and Heads; full of ≈øcattered pieces of Wood of Coffins, of little Idols, ≈øome of Wood, others of Plai≈øter embolli≈øh'd with green, and mark'd before and behind with Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Letters. The≈øe Idols the <hi>Arabians</hi> have taken from the broken <hi>Mommies</hi> which they have ca≈øt away. In ≈øome places you may ≈øee great Tomb-≈øtones, full of Cyphers and enigmatical Figures that repre≈øent ≈øomething of Chymi≈øtry, and of other Sciences and My≈øteries; and full of ≈øtrange Characters that are no Hieroglyphicks. Whiles I was looking upon this Spectacle the <hi>Arabians</hi> brought me two, whereof I cau≈øed the Coppies to be drawn as ≈øoon as I was returned to
<hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have here a De≈øcription of ≈øome Relicks of the Grandeur and Vanity of the ancient <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and the mournful ≈øigns of Man's Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The fir≈øt ≈øight is able to da≈øh a Per≈øon newly arrived, out of Countenance, and to affright him: I mean the ≈øight of ≈øo many Bones all ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <pb n="92" facs="tcp:106091:50"/>up and down, one would think that here hath been a grievous fight.</p>
                  <p>In this Champain, or Field, here are fifteen <hi>Pyramides:</hi> three are of an extraordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, which ≈øeem to have been favour'd by Time; for they appear entire without much decay. Here is al≈øo an entrance in every one, that ≈øhews a long Alley which leads to a Chamber; Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur
<hi>de Tiger</hi> went into that which is farthe≈øt from the Village, commonly named <hi>The Pyramide of Rodope,</hi> where he found nothing in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Pyramide</hi> is built as a Pavillion. The
<hi>Francs</hi> ≈øay that <hi>Rodope,</hi> a famous Strumpet, caus'd it to be built with the Money that ≈øhe had gotten with the lo≈øs of her honour. But this is doubtle≈øs an error, if it be true what <hi>Pliny</hi> ≈øaith, That the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramide</hi> of <hi>Rodope</hi> was but ≈ømall, though very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; therefore this which is one of the greate≈øt in all <hi>Egypt</hi> cannot be that of <hi>Rodope.</hi> The≈øe are the words of <hi>Pliny: Supremumque illud ne quis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum opes miretur, minimam extiti≈ø≈øe laudati≈ø≈øimam √† Rodope meretricula factam. Ae≈øopi fabularum Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophi con≈øerva quondam, &amp; contubernalis haec fuit, majore miraculo tantas opes meretricio e≈ø≈øe conqui≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas quae≈øtu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the others that are in the ≈øame Field, Time hath almo≈øt worn them out; for they are but ≈øo many heaps of Sand, which have ≈øcarce the ≈øhape and ≈øhadow of what they have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
                  <p>Here is al≈øo a ≈øquare heap of very great hewn Stones. The
<hi>Arabians</hi> name it <hi>Ma≈øtabet Faraoun:</hi> for they ≈øay, that when the <hi>Pharaoh's,</hi> Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were to declare and give a new <pb n="93" facs="tcp:106091:50"/>Law to to the People, they ≈øtood on the top of this heap. But the≈øe are the Traditions of the poor <hi>Arabians</hi> that have nothing of certainty.</p>
                  <p>To return to the Wells of the <hi>Mommies:</hi> as ≈øoon as the
<hi>Francs</hi> have vi≈øited any, the Wind, or the <hi>Arabians,</hi> fill the entry again full of Sand, to get a little Money at the ≈øecond opening. This is the greate≈øt gain of the≈øe Wretches. The lea≈øt they take for to open a Virgin Well is thirty <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øters,</hi> becau≈øe they that make the Well to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, have the liberty to carry away all the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio≈øities and
<hi>Mommies</hi> that he finds there.</p>
                  <p>We return'd, after two days ab≈øence, to the City
<hi>Cairo</hi> again; and the 6th of <hi>May</hi> I went to vi≈øit the
<hi>Greek</hi> Arch-Bi≈øhop of <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> who was then re≈øident at <hi>Cairo</hi> about ≈øome concerns of his Mona≈øtery. Among≈øt other things, he told me that he had a Manu≈øcript of the Council of
<hi>Florence,</hi> differing from all tho≈øe Copies that are Printed in
<hi>Europe.</hi> Mon≈øieur <hi>de Tiger</hi> hath a Copy of this ≈øuppo≈øed Original.</p>
                  <p>The Monks of this Mona≈øtery have a priviledge from
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> ≈øigned according to the Cu≈øtome of that time by the impre≈ø≈øion of his Hand, which frees them from the <hi>Carach,</hi> or Tax, which the <hi>Mahometans</hi> require of the Chri≈øtians ≈øubject to them. This was the cau≈øe wherefore <hi>Mahomet</hi> granted them this favour, as the Arch-Bi≈øhop told me, to expre≈øs his thanks to that Hou≈øe for the kind entertainment which he had received at the hands of tho≈øe Monks when he kept, and watch'd over their Camels.</p>
                  <p>We di≈øcours'd afterwards concerning the Plague of the former Year. He told me, that it had ≈øwept away ≈øix hundred and four≈øcore thou≈øand <pb n="94" facs="tcp:106091:51"/>Per≈øons, but that it had ≈øcarce medled with any but the poor; and that of the richer fort ≈øcarce four hundred were dead.</p>
                  <p>This cau≈øeth me to ≈øpeak a word of Father <hi>Elzear</hi> of
<hi>Nants,</hi> a very worthy Per≈øon; and his Comrade, Father
<hi>Portais;</hi> both of the <hi>Capuchin</hi> Order, and zealous
<hi>Mi≈ø≈øionaries,</hi> whom this Plague carried away. The fir≈øt was buried out of the City <hi>Cairo,</hi> in a Field where the poor
<hi>Copies</hi> are buried, for who≈øe Conver≈øion he was intended.</p>
                  <p>To honour the Memory of his Vertues, there is an Epitaph in
<hi>Arab.</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> upon a little Stone fixed upon his Grave; and becau≈øe I was well acquainted with him in my fir≈øt Voyage which I made into <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the Orders and Commands of <hi>Erne≈øt,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Saxa-Gota,</hi> in the Year 1664. I went to ≈øee his Grave, and to repeat for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe of his Soul, and as a Te≈øtimony of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and e≈øteem of his rare Qualities, the Prayer <hi>De profundis.</hi>

                  <p>WHen the time was come that the <hi>Copties</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the Fe≈øtival of the Aparitions of the Saints at <hi>Gemiane;</hi> becau≈øe I had not ≈øeen it in my fir≈øt Voyage, I went from <hi>Cairo</hi> on
<hi>Monday</hi> the 9th of <hi>May,</hi> with a Servant of Mon≈øieur <hi>de Tiger,</hi> named <hi>Leonard,</hi> that could Paint very well, with ≈øeveral
<hi>Copties</hi> who came in our Company, becau≈øe they had nothing to di≈øcharge the expence of this Journy. We went aboard at <hi>Boulac,</hi> and ≈øet ≈øail for the Town of <hi>Man≈øoura,</hi> where we landed the 12th of the ≈øame Month.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:106091:51"/>
                  <p>The next day we left <hi>Man≈øoura,</hi> taking a Boat for
<hi>Dia≈øt,</hi> a little Village ≈øcituate upon the <hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Niltus;</hi> for here all Travellers that go to <hi>Gemiane</hi> from
<hi>Cairo</hi> are wont to land. It ≈øtands about four hours journying from
<hi>Man≈øoura.</hi> At our landing we left our Boat and went by Land to
<hi>Bo≈ø≈øat ino≈ø≈ø√°ra,</hi> a little Mile di≈øtant from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in the Land; we ≈øpent there the Night, and lodg'din the Church of S.
<hi>George,</hi> with ≈øeveral other <hi>Copties</hi> whom we found there, who were bound al≈øo, as well as we, for <hi>Gemiane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 14th day very early we proceeded on towards the third branch of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, as I have already ≈øaid in the De≈øcription of this River, at <hi>Sciobret il Yemen;</hi> which it hath pa≈øs'd near the Town of <hi>Mohelle Keb√≠re,</hi> or Great <hi>Mohelle,</hi> and near
<hi>Gemiane</hi> it di≈øcharges it ≈øelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea at <hi>Brullos.</hi> We march'd on into the Country, and when we came to this Branch of the River we found ≈øeveral Boats ready to carry us with the Current to <hi>Gemiane,</hi> where we land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Evening, not without ≈øuffering many cro≈ø≈øes, and inconveniences; becau≈øe the Ma≈øter of the Boat, an <hi>Arabian,</hi> was a wicked Rogue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gemiane</hi> is a famous Church of the <hi>Copties,</hi> built in a large Champain; very even and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs to the Eye, but very unfruitful, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Garbie</hi> in the I≈øle of
<hi>Delta.</hi> It ≈øtands near the place where was anciently the City
<hi>Degue,</hi> called by the <hi>Copties Tekebi.</hi> On the <hi>We≈øt</hi> it hath the Great <hi>Mohelle,</hi> on the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> the Branch of the River that enters into the Sea at <hi>Brullos,</hi> and on the <hi>North</hi> the Mediteranean Sea. This Church hath five and twenty Arches, or I≈øles, that yield at a di≈øtance a very beautiful Pro≈øpect, <pb n="96" facs="tcp:106091:52"/>though they be not in order nor equal in bigne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>The Church within is not yet fini≈øh'd, and there is but one Chappel whited with Lime, namely that where the ≈øuppo≈øed Apparition happens: there is al≈øo but one Altar, as in all other Churches of the
<hi>Levant.</hi> All the Iles, or Arches, ≈øerve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Church, and to give light to it; for in every one there is a Window, and in ≈øome two. The Chappel where the Apparition happens is on the <hi>North</hi>-≈øide, on the right hand as one enters in, and over again≈øt the Door.</p>
                  <p>During three days I examin'd this Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the cau≈øes from whence it proceeds as exactly as I could po≈ø≈øibly; and found it to be nothing el≈øe but the reflection of the Objects that went by the Church at a convenient di≈øtance, which being carried into the Chappel, by the Air, through the two Windows that give light. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øents, over again≈øt upon the Wall, the Shadow which is like the Object that goes by: For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; when a Hor≈øe-man goes by, there is to be ≈øeen upon the Wall, in a confu≈øed manner, a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a Man on Hor≈øe-back. If it be a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath a Child in her Arms, one may ≈øee the Shadow of that appearance; and ≈øo is it with all other things. Now the People being ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitious and of a dull apprehen≈øion, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how this happens, fancy that the Saints ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them.</p>
                  <p>They know and di≈øtingui≈øh them, according as they are painted in their Churches: For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they ≈øee the Shadow that repre≈øents a Cavalier, they ≈øay that it is S. <hi>George;</hi> for the
<hi>Copties,</hi> as well as the other People of the <hi>Ea≈øt,</hi> repre≈øent him as a Man on Hor≈øe-back, killing a <pb n="97" facs="tcp:106091:52"/>Dragon. When they ≈øee a Woman carrying of an Infant in her Arms, they ≈øay that it is the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed Virgin, becau≈øe they ≈øee her thus repre≈øented in the Pictures of their Churches. When they ≈øee the Shadow of a Man on foot of a reddi≈øh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they ≈øay that it is S. <hi>Menna,</hi> becau≈øe they paint him with a red Habit. They di≈øtingui≈øh the other Saints in the ≈øame manner. They are ≈øo much bewitch'd with the fancy of the reality of the≈øe Apparitions, that if any Per≈øon ≈øhould offer to deny it, he would be in danger to be knock'd on the head.</p>
                  <p>It is in vain to an≈øwer that the Shadows that appear in this Chappel cannot be formed by the reflection of the Objects, becau≈øe the Windows, through which they come in, are at the <hi>North</hi>-≈øide of the Church which never enjoys the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhine; and that therefore they be true and real Apparitions.</p>
                  <p>To this I reply, that it is not needful that the Church be enlighten'd on that ≈øide; but it is ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that the Objects that pa≈øs by be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd. Now if the Church had the light of the Sun on that ≈øide, the brightne≈øs of the light would di≈øcover too plainly the Shadows, and would take away all cau≈øes of admiration.</p>
                  <p>If any will ≈øay that ≈øome ingenious Per≈øon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them hath built this Chappel, according to the Rules of the Optick Art, to deceive the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the≈øe Apparitions; I de≈øire him to take notice that the
<hi>Copties</hi> are ≈øo ignorant that they know not what this Art is. This Chappel, as the other Churches, hath been built in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner without any de≈øign to cozen the World; therefore this Reflection, which they name Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition <pb n="98" facs="tcp:106091:53"/>of the Saints, hath been di≈øcover'd by chance. Experience hath taught me this in other Churches which have not been builded no more than this to deceive the World with vain Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions. I have taken notice of it in the Church <hi>Bo≈ø≈øat ino≈ø≈ø√°ra,</hi> where I was on the 13th of the ≈øame Month, in the company of ≈øome
<hi>Copties</hi> that were going to <hi>Gemiane<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                     </hi> There I ≈øaw the ≈øame Shadows, which two days after at <hi>Gemiane,</hi> they called S.
<hi>George,</hi> the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and S. <hi>Menna;</hi> ≈øo that when the <hi>Copties</hi> perceived them they knew not what to ≈øay. By this we may judge, that this Church hath not been built by the Optick Rules of Art, and that only by chance the≈øe Shadows have appeared, and been taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>This Apparition continues three days follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in which time there is ≈øuch a great concour≈øe of People, that one is ready to be ≈øtifled. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they did call every Saint according to their devotion and re≈øpect, without order: And when they ≈øaw ≈øome Shadows upon the Wall which had a relation with tho≈øe Saints that are painted in their Churches, they cry out for joy, in their Language, <hi>Selam lak Kaddis Filan; I ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you √¥ Saint N. N.</hi> To this they add an Hymn proper to the Saint, and Prayers, tying upon the Wall ≈øome little cro≈ø≈øes of Wax. Of all the Saints that their Church wor≈øhips, I have heard none called upon but the ble≈ø≈øed Virgin, S. <hi>George,</hi> S. <hi>Menna,</hi> and S.
<hi>Porter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On this Fe≈øtival day all the <hi>Arabians</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts meet here, out of an ancient Cu≈øtome, to be treated for three days with the Revenues of this Church: When I was there, they could make up near five hundred Hor≈øe, and five hundred <pb n="99" facs="tcp:106091:53"/>Foot. The Hor≈øe-men were Armed with a Lance, the Foot-men with a Club upon their Shoulders, pointed with Iron.</p>
                  <p>This Cu≈øtome of feeding the <hi>Arabians</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts is very ancient; it comes from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be the Lords of the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout where this Church is built, and therefore for this con≈øideration they hinder not the Chri≈øtians, as they are able, from coming to this Fe≈øtival.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the <hi>Epitrope,</hi> or Trea≈øurer of the Church, hath care to provide all things needful for their entertainment. He kill'd that year ≈øeven young Cows, two every day: He provided for them Rice, Bread, and Barly for their Cattel: He had a care al≈øo to ≈øend for Cooks, and all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements nece≈ø≈øary for a Kitchin; ≈øo that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> had nothing el≈øe to do here, but to eat and drink and divert them≈øelves.</p>
                  <p>Twice every every day, the≈øe <hi>Arabians</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their War-like Exerci≈øes, to ≈øhew their jolly humor, and to give ≈øport to the A≈ø≈øembly. The Hor≈øe-men played at <hi>Girit,</hi> or the Dart, by ca≈øting it to one another, riding one again≈øt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fencing therewith with much dexterity: The Footmen likewi≈øe skirmi≈øh'd one again≈øt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother very plea≈øantly with their great Staves.</p>
                  <p>The third day of this Fe≈øtival the <hi>Arabians</hi> have nothing given them but a Dinner, as ≈øoon as they have eaten it they are to depart; ≈øo that if two hours after any of them was found there, and that the
<hi>Beys</hi> Lieutenant hath any knowledge of him; he will cau≈øe him to be puni≈øh'd, either by the Pur≈øe, or a Ba≈øtinado: ≈øo that none have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ≈øtay there that day, but Chri≈øtians whom the <hi>Epitrope</hi> treats in the ≈øame manner as he doth the <hi>Arabians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:106091:54"/>
                  <p>I was one of the chief Per≈øons invited, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurer entertained me under his own tent with an extraordinary Banquet, only Wine was wanting; and Spoons, Forks, Knives and Napkins were not u≈øed: The Meat was to be torn in pieces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fingers, according to the Cu≈øtome of the Country. Afterwards, out of the Tent, a long Skin of Leather was ≈øpread upon the ground for the ordinary People, where they were very well treated. I ≈øhall fini≈øh this Relation with an advice to all <hi>Francs</hi> that intend to ≈øee this Fe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. They ought to take the ≈øame Way as we have done, becau≈øe it is the ea≈øie≈øt, the mo≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and the le≈øs dangerous. Let them get a good Tent; for there are no Lodgings, but in the open Air: Let them carry Wine, Strong-waters, Meat, Hens, Bread, and other things for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment during the Fe≈øtival: Let them al≈øo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them the Furniture of the Table, a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, a Cu≈øhion to ≈øit upon, and ≈øome Coverlets for their conveniency, and to appear hand≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Water and Wood, are here plenty: There is Fi≈øh al≈øo to be ≈øold; for the Fi≈øher-men of
<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> that is near adjoining, bring hither a great deal. I was provided with all the≈øe things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I appeared very decently.</p>
                  <p>There is here no danger of being robb'd; for the Lieutenant of the <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Mohelle</hi> is al≈øo at this Fe≈øtival with a good Guard of <hi>Spahins,</hi> to prevent Di≈øorders, Quarrels, and Robberies which might happen among rude and barbarous People: So that in this place one may be with as much ≈øafety as at <hi>Cairo</hi> in a Hou≈øe. Upon this account there happen'd a plea≈øant Accident; a poor <hi>Arabian</hi> had taken from a Chri≈øtian a handful of Barly to give <pb n="101" facs="tcp:106091:54"/>it to his A≈øs, he was taken upon the Fact: The Chri≈øtians immediately dragg'd him with a great noi≈øe, to the <hi>Beys</hi> Lieutenant to have him puni≈øh'd: Whiles they were leading him a great Tumult of People ran to ≈øee him; ≈øome upbraided him with his boldne≈øs and impudency to ≈øteal, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the puni≈øhment of the Saints that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in their Church, and did ≈øo many great Miracles; another ask'd him whether he did not fear that God would puni≈øh him? At which words he an≈øwer'd, <hi>Ane Baaref rabbene;</hi> that is, <hi>What, do I know that there is a God?</hi> or, <hi>I know not what is God.</hi> This cau≈øed me to wonder, both at the
<hi>Copties</hi> ≈øettled per≈øwa≈øion of the real Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of their Saints, and at the ignorance of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> ≈øeeing that ≈øome of them know not that there is a God. At la≈øt this Wretch was ≈øhut up in a Cage, and I know not what happen'd to him afterwards.</p>
                  <p>It is time to prepare to depart when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany withdraws it ≈øelf; and if one de≈øires to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Cairo</hi> by another way, one may go by Land to <hi>Brullos,</hi> from thence to <hi>Ro≈øetta;</hi> by this means one may go through the lower part of <hi>Delta:</hi> a curious Journy which I never heard that any <hi>Franc</hi> hath made. But in ca≈øe any danger is likely to be in this way, one may go from <hi>Gemiane</hi> to Great
<hi>Mohelle,</hi> where the ways are full of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and from thence one may go by Land to <hi>Cairo,</hi> and ≈øee all the Antiquities that be in
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helle</hi> and all along the wav.</p>
                  <p>I went away on <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> morning when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was departing, and returned to <hi>Cairo</hi> the ≈øame way that I came, becau≈øe the other ways ≈øeem'd to be dangerous. I arrived at <hi>Cairo</hi> the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106091:55"/>20th of the ≈øame Month, eleven days after my departure.</p>

                  <p>On the 27th of <hi>May</hi> I went to vi≈øit the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of the <hi>Copties,</hi> called <hi>Muallim Mattaos,</hi> or Ma≈øter
<hi>Matthew,</hi> whom I had ≈øeen in my fir≈øt Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. I intreated him to give me a Letter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me to the Mona≈øteries of Saint
<hi>Macari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whither I intended to go, which he granted me very willingly.</p>
                  <p>The 30th of this Month a <hi>Bey</hi> of
<hi>Con≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> arrived at <hi>Cairo,</hi> bound for the I≈øland of
<hi>Suaquen,</hi> ≈øcituated in the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> where he was to Govern as <hi>Pacha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ≈øame time came <hi>Don Pietro,</hi> an
<hi>Aby≈ø≈øin,</hi> whom I had known at <hi>Rome,</hi> and who had given me the Manu≈øcripts of the Synods, and the Old Te≈øtament written in the
<hi>Ethiopian</hi> Language. He, and another of the ≈øame Nation named
<hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> went with this <hi>Pacha,</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to get into their own Country.

                  <p>ON <hi>Monday</hi> the la≈øt of <hi>May,</hi> I went out of
<hi>Cairo</hi> de≈øigned for <hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> with the ≈øame
<hi>Leonard</hi> who had been with me at <hi>Gemiane,</hi> and a
<hi>Nubian</hi> Slave that I had. I went thither on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to ≈øpend there the time of the violent heats, which are not ≈øo fierce in that City as at
<hi>Cairo;</hi> 
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:106091:55"/>as al≈øo to ≈øee the Mouth of the River
<hi>Nilus</hi> at that City, and to ≈øatisfie a doubt that I had about the Water, of <hi>Maad√≠e;</hi> for I knew not whether it was a Gulph, or a Mouth of the River <hi>Nilus:</hi> with an intention from thence to go to
<hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> to ≈øee its Curio≈øities.</p>
                  <p>We were four days going from <hi>Cairo</hi> to
<hi>Ro≈øetta;</hi> an extraordinary long time, becau≈øe the winds
<hi>Maltam,</hi> or <hi>Mae≈øtraux,</hi> that blow again≈øt tho≈øe that go down the River, oppo≈øed our Voyage.</p>
                  <p>The mo≈øt remarkable Towns in this way are, <hi>Fuva, Sindiun, Teirut, Motubis,</hi> and <hi>Tf√©ni,</hi> by the River ≈øide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fuva,</hi> called by the <hi>Greeks Metelis,</hi> and in the
<hi>Copties</hi> Dictionary <hi>Me≈ø≈øil,</hi> is a very ancient, great, and con≈øiderable Town, ≈øcituated upon the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide of
<hi>Nilus,</hi> ≈øeven hours travelling from <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øetta.</hi> Its Territory is very delightful, becau≈øe of the plea≈øant Fields and Gardens round about. It bears Fruits that are much e≈øteem'd in all
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Geziret Iddahab,</hi> or <hi>the I≈øland of Gold,</hi> is over again≈øt this City.</p>
                  <p>Heretofore the River was ≈øo deep from the Mouth as far as this Town, that great Barques loaden were able to ≈øail hither; at that time the Cu≈øtom-hou≈øe was kept here. But in time the River becoming here ≈øo ≈øhallow that the Barques being not able to come ≈øo far, the Cu≈øtom-hou≈øe hath been ≈øince e≈øtabli≈øh'd at <hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> where it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues yet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sindiun</hi> and <hi>Teirut</hi> are two other Towns ≈øcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upon the Banks of <hi>Nilus</hi> over again≈øt one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; as are al≈øo <hi>Mot√∫bis</hi> and <hi>Tf√©ni:</hi> the fir≈øt ≈øtands on the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide, the other on the
<hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:106091:56"/>
                  <p>At <hi>Ro≈øetta</hi> I lodged with Mon≈øieur <hi>Reynaud,</hi> Vice-Con≈øul of the <hi>French</hi> in this City; he is a very hone≈øt Man: He imployed all his credit to procure me the ≈øight of the Curio≈øities round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
                  <p>For the information of all <hi>European</hi> Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, I have taken notice that of late there is a Carrier ≈øet up at <hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> who goes by Land to <hi>Damietta,</hi> when any de≈øires to travel that way, which conveniency was not formerly; for when any intended that Journey, he was to run many hazards and inconveniences. I had fir≈øt de≈øign'd to go thither, but in≈øtead of that Journey I went to vi≈øit the Mona≈øteries of the De≈øart of S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius,</hi> where I expected more ≈øatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>I have long doubted whether the Waters of
<hi>Maad√≠e,</hi> or the Pool, that is half-way between
<hi>Ro≈øetta</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> was a Branch of <hi>Nilus,</hi> or el≈øe a Gulph of the Sea. In another Relation of <hi>Egypt</hi> which I Printed in <hi>Italian</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year 1671. I have ≈øaid that it was a Branch of <hi>Nilus;</hi> but ≈øince I have under≈øtood the truth that it was nothing but a Gulph, or Pool: for, 1. Its Waters are very ≈øalt as far as <hi>Etku,</hi> its uttermo≈øt bounds; which Town, as I conceive, is the ≈øame with <hi>Motubis.</hi> 2. This Water comes not from
<hi>Nilus,</hi> neither hath any Corre≈øpondency with this River. True it is, when <hi>Nilus</hi> overflows it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ≈øweeter, becau≈øe of the mixture of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's-water with the Water of this Gulph. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains this ≈øweetne≈øs about two Months, until <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> leaves the Fields; and as ≈øoon as the <hi>Tramon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> or <hi>We≈øterly</hi> Wind blows, the Waters of this Pool return to their wonted ≈øaltne≈øs and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:106091:56"/>
                  <p>The 10th of <hi>June</hi> I went to the Mouth of the River
<hi>Nilus,</hi> about an hours ≈øailing from <hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> to take the De≈øcription of it.</p>
                  <p>I took notice that <hi>Nilus</hi> hath there two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or Mouths, though they be reckoned but one. That which runs into the Sea towards the <hi>Ea≈øt,</hi> and is called the <hi>Ea≈øterly Mouth;</hi> and that which runs into the Sea towards the <hi>We≈øt,</hi> and is named the
<hi>We≈øterly Mouth.</hi> They take the fir≈øt to ≈øail to <hi>Brullos,</hi> to <hi>Damietta,</hi> to <hi>Seyda,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantinople, &amp;c</hi> and by this la≈øt they go to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and other
<hi>We≈øtern</hi> Parts. This ≈øeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceeds from a low I≈øland, very ≈ømall, which ≈øtands in the middle of the River next to the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Mouth of <hi>Nilus</hi> next to this City, is Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with two Ca≈øtles; one ≈øtands at the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide of the River, and the other at the <hi>We≈øt.</hi> That which is about a Mile and a half from
<hi>Ro≈øetta</hi> is ≈øquare, encompa≈ø≈øed about with ≈øtrong Walls, built according to the old Model, having four Towers. In the middle is a high Dungeon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat at la≈øt. One hundred four≈øcore and four
<hi>Jani≈ø≈øaries</hi> are there in Gari≈øon. They lye every Night in the Gari≈øon, but in the Day-time they have liberty to go into the City to work for their living. It is furni≈øh'd with three≈øcore and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pieces of Cannon, ≈øeven are of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bigne≈øs. The <hi>Aga</hi> that Commanded here in chief, was a <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Renegado.</p>
                  <p>The other Ca≈øtle is but a <hi>Mo≈øque,</hi> before it ≈øtands ≈øeven Pieces of Artillery on the Ground: Here Commands al≈øo an
<hi>Aga</hi> over a Company of <hi>Moors,</hi> who examine all that go in, or out of the City. When I attempted to go out, they came <pb n="106" facs="tcp:106091:57"/>to my Boat and obliged me to return into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again, though the
<hi>Jani≈ø≈øary</hi> that was with me, and well acquainted with them, offered to an≈øwer for me. They treated me in this manner, for fear of a Pirat of
<hi>Malta</hi> that ≈øailed before the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at that time; they were afraid that I had ≈øome intelligence with him, to give him notice of ≈øome Ships that were ready to ≈øet ≈øail loaden from <hi>Ro≈øetta:</hi> Neverthele≈øs I had another opportunity to take the De≈øcription of this Mouth al≈øo. It is now in the Clo≈øet of that Per≈øon of Quality who hath the others.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE 14th of <hi>June</hi> I went, in the Evening, from
<hi>Ro≈øetta</hi> towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with a <hi>Moor</hi> recommended to me by the <hi>French</hi> Vice-Con≈øul of this City: We had two Mules to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us, for which I paid ≈øeventeen <hi>Meidins</hi> for the whole Journy.</p>
                  <p>About Midnight we came to the Water, named by the <hi>Moors Maad√≠e.</hi> After a little ≈øtay in the <hi>Han,</hi> or publick Inn, we proceeded on in our Journey in a Moon-≈øhining Night towards
<hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria;</hi> where we arriv'd the next day about eight or nine a Clock. From <hi>Ro≈øetta</hi> to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> there is ten hours travelling for a Hor≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; the mo≈øt part of the way is along the Sea-Coa≈øt, ≈øo that the Bea≈øts have a long way their Feet in Water.</p>
                  <p>The Country is ≈øo even, that there is no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Travellers; and unle≈øs it be the <hi>Han,</hi> 
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:106091:57"/>in the Mid-way, there is neither Village, nor Tree, nor Gra≈øs to be ≈øeen: It is nothing but a plain Champain of Sand, altogether unfruitful.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Franc</hi> is bound to pay, at the entrance into
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> at the Gate of <hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> three <hi>Para's;</hi> half to the <hi>Beduins,</hi> or <hi>Boemiens,</hi> and half to the
<hi>Jani≈ø≈øaries,</hi> becau≈øe they are there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Guard.</p>
                  <p>At my fir≈øt arrival at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> on the 15th of the ≈øame Month, I went to ≈øalute Mon≈øieur <hi>Laurens,</hi> Vice-Con≈øul in this City for the <hi>French;</hi> who expre≈øt a great deal of civility to me, and offered me his Table and a Chamber in his Hou≈øe; but in regard I was recommended by Mon≈øieur <hi>Brou≈ø≈øon,</hi> the Factor of the
<hi>Levant</hi> Company, to Mon≈øieur <hi>Sabatery,</hi> his intimate Friend, and Factor there, and in regard he had a convenient Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he offer'd me, to content them both I lodg'd with Mon≈øieur <hi>Sabatery,</hi> and made u≈øe of the Vice-Con≈øul's Table all the time I ≈øtaid at
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went next to vi≈øit an intimate Friend, with whom I had an acquaintance in my fir≈øt Voyage to <hi>Egypt;</hi> he was called <hi>Komos Jean,</hi> Arch-Prie≈øt of the Church of S. <hi>Mark</hi> of the
<hi>Copties:</hi> He is an under≈øtanding, and an hone≈øt Man, and hath informed me much concerning the affairs of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I under≈øtood from the <hi>French</hi> Merchants of this City, that their <hi>Fondego</hi> hath been built by the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi>'s order for their Lodging; and ≈øince their e≈øtabli≈øhment in this City the
<hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh Emperours</hi> were wont to pay to the <hi>French</hi> Con≈øuls ever Year two hundred Crowns for the Reparations of this Hou≈øe, but of late they don't <pb n="108" facs="tcp:106091:58"/>≈øee this Money: The cau≈øe is not well known.</p>
                  <p>On the 16th of this Month I went to a <hi>Jews</hi> Hou≈øe, with an intention to buy of him a curious Hieroglyphick Stone that ≈øtands at the Thre≈øhold of his Door. It is about an Ell and a-half long, and about a Foot broad, of a Marble colour; upon which are graven three lines of Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick Letters in very ≈ømall Characters, which are to be read from the left hand to the right.</p>
                  <p>This Stone was de≈øired by Mon≈øieur <hi>Thevenot,</hi> who endeavoured to buy it; he offered, as I was told, thirty <hi>Pia≈øters</hi> to this <hi>Jew</hi> for it; but the other ask'd an hundred.</p>
                  <p>All the People of the <hi>Levant</hi> have this fooli≈øh Cu≈øtome to rai≈øe the Price of their Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; when they ≈øee that a
<hi>Franc</hi> de≈øires any thing, though it were but a trifle, the others de≈øire makes them think it to be unvaluable; they prize it therefore at ≈øuch a rate that none dare meddle with it: They are ≈øo ≈øimple to ≈øuffer the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to lie upon their Hands and ≈øpoil, rather than to ≈øell it to a <hi>Franc</hi> at the ≈øame rate that they would give it to a Man of the
<hi>Levant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neverthele≈øs I expected that the <hi>Jew</hi> had chang'd his mind ≈øince that time; I offer'd him the ≈øame Price that this <hi>Franc</hi> had offer'd before: but when I ≈øaw that my offer render'd him more proud, re≈øolved in his fir≈øt demand, I never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The Lodgings of the ≈øeventy Interpreters, who Tran≈ølated the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible into <hi>Greek,</hi> are yet ≈øtanding in this City, almo≈øt entire, with the Clo≈øets where they performed their Work. The
<hi>Turks</hi> have made a <hi>Mo≈øque</hi> there, which they name
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106091:58"/>
                     <hi>Giama il garb√≠e,</hi> or the <hi>Mo≈øque</hi> of the <hi>Levant.</hi> It is to be ≈øeen with Money: Mon≈øieur
<hi>Brue,</hi> chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the <hi>French</hi> Con≈øul of
<hi>Cairo,</hi> hath gone in.</p>
                  <p>The 19th of <hi>June,</hi> being <hi>Saturday,</hi> I went to ≈øee the Salt-pits of the Grand <hi>Seignior,</hi> which are out of the City near the <hi>Calitz</hi> or <hi>Channel</hi> of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> from whence they have their Fre≈øh-water when the River runs over the Banks, and near the Garden of a <hi>Moor</hi> often vi≈øited by the <hi>French</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, which is call'd <hi>Gheit il chavagie,</hi> or <hi>the Merchants Garden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the≈øe Salt-pits I have taken notice of two things very remarkable: Fir≈øt, that the Water of <hi>Nilus,</hi> the ≈øweete≈øt Water and the fre≈øhe≈øt in the World, makes a Salt, not only whiter than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, but very excellent. Secondly, that this Salt hath the ta≈øte of Violets.</p>
                  <p>They that have the care of tho≈øe Salt-pits cau≈øe a certain quantity of the River-water to run into the Salt-pits; and ≈øour or five days after the Water is turn'd into a Salt the mo≈øt beautiful to the Eye, afterwards they carry it in Baskets to dry in the Sun; then it is fit to be ≈øold.</p>
                  <p>Salt is al≈øo to be made of the Lake <hi>Sebaka,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ancient <hi>Latins, Palus Mareotis,</hi> which is at the
<hi>South</hi>-≈øide of this City; but its Water is naturally ≈øalt, and its Salt is bitter when it is made, therefore they neglect it.</p>
                  <p>This Lake proceeds from the River <hi>Nilus</hi> when it overflows; the Waters there continue, becau≈øe they have no pa≈ø≈øage out. It is not very deep, but ≈øo large that from one ≈øide one cannot well ≈øee the other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> have in their Church <pb n="110" facs="tcp:106091:59"/>of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> a Picture of the Arch-Angel S.
<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> drawn by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> as report goes.</p>
                  <p>Mon≈øieur <hi>Luca≈øole,</hi> Chancellor of the
<hi>French</hi> Nation in this City, told me that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had carried away this Picture ≈øome time-≈øince, and ≈øail'd with it five times out of the Haven, but could not proceed on in their Voyage, becau≈øe they were ≈øtopt by an invi≈øible Hand every time that they intended to ≈øail away, and could never depart till they had carried back the Picture.</p>
                  <p>The report of this Wonder being ≈øpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the City; the <hi>Beduins,</hi> or <hi>Boemiens</hi> as we call them, took a re≈øolution ≈øecretly to ≈øteal it away and ≈øell it to the <hi>Francs:</hi> Accordingly, when they had broken open the Doors of the Church and pulled it down from the place where it ≈øtood, they could not po≈ø≈øibly get out with it; ≈øo that they were al≈øo forc'd to put it up again in its place as the
<hi>Venetians</hi> had done before, where it remains ≈øtill, I have ≈øeen it.</p>
                  <p>Mon≈øieur <hi>Luca≈øole</hi> told me that this is very true, and that he him≈øelf was then at <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have read ≈øomething concerning the Waters of the Ci≈øterns of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the Book of Mon≈øieur <hi>de la Ch.</hi> that treats of the overflowing of the River <hi>Nilus:</hi> That they become ≈øalt about the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> and that in the Night that the fruitful Dew falls they return to their former ≈øweetne≈øs, and increa≈øe be≈øides with the Waters of the River.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall not offer to deny flatly a thing that may be true, and which Mon≈øieur <hi>Burattini,</hi> cited by Mon≈øieur <hi>de la Ch.</hi> ≈øaith hath been ob≈øerv'd by ≈øeveral Per≈øons: But I dare ≈øay that in two ≈øeveral Voyages into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and during my long abode
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106091:59"/>at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in ≈øeveral ≈øea≈øons of the Year; though I have ob≈øerv'd, as exactly as I could, all things, I never heard that the Waters of the≈øe Ci≈øterns did become ≈øalt, or that they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe with the Waters of the River, or that they did recover their former fre≈øhne≈øs and ≈øweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs: I have neverthele≈øs wondred a little to ta≈øte them ≈øomewhat ≈øalt, ≈øo that they ≈øeem not to come from ≈øo fre≈øh a River.</p>
                  <p>This quality proceeds from the nitrous Earth, which may be known by this Experiment; if a piece of Earth about <hi>Alexandria</hi> be put in the hot Sun, it will become white as Snow on that ≈øide that is towards the Sun.</p>

The cau≈øe of this are the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who out of a per≈øwa≈øion of ≈øome great Trea≈øure hid under, have digg'd and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd it, and have drawn out of its Foundation ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great heaps of Stones that held it up; this cau≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to lean a little on that ≈øide. They had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown it, had they not found at the bottom <pb n="102" facs="tcp:106091:60"/>Stones of a fearful bigne≈øs, and ≈øo great that neither they nor any body el≈øe was able to draw them out.</p>
                  <p>The De≈øcription and Dimen≈øions of this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar are found in the Book of Mon≈øieur <hi>Thevenot:</hi> Therefore I ≈øay no more of it here, becau≈øe I will not ≈øtuff this Book with ordinary things, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before in other Travels.</p>
                  <p>After we had well viewed this Pillar, we march'd along the
<hi>Calitz,</hi> as far as the place that is over again≈øt the City Walls, to ob≈øerve the Pa≈ø≈øage of the Waters. We went with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign on the other ≈øide of the <hi>Calitz,</hi> over the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bridge that is near it: When we came to the little Arches that are under the Walls, through which the River enters into the City, we made our ob≈øervations, and took next the way that leads to the Caves that are in the Fields at <hi>We≈øt-South-We≈øt</hi> of the Gate out of which we came; and about a quarter of a League, in our way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lake <hi>Sebaca,</hi> we came to the Caves; having left at
<hi>We≈øt-North-We≈øt</hi> a <hi>Mo≈øque,</hi> in a plain Field, where was buried a certain <hi>Schech</hi> of the <hi>Moors,</hi> called <hi>Sidi gams il g√°bbari.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At our entrance we went down a dozen ≈øteps into a very large Alley, digg'd in the Rock, but open a-top; it may be the Vault is fallen by length of time. In this Alley are fifteen great holes cut in the Rock, in the fa≈øhion of great Gates; ≈øeven are on the right hand, and eight on the left; through which Men enter into the Caves.</p>
                  <p>We went into four with our Torches lighted, our
<hi>Jani≈ø≈øary</hi> before us; we found round about the Walls, in the firm Rock, from the top to the <pb n="113" facs="tcp:106091:60"/>bottom, holes cut in the Rock very orderly; and of a length and breadth fit to hold a Coffin: Many of the≈øe Caves were cut, to open a way to others. This inconveniency we found there, they were almo≈øt all fill'd up with Earth and Sand, which cau≈øed us to kneel for the mo≈øt part: this did not hinder us from taking notice of that which was mo≈øt remarkable. Whiles we were in one, at the end of the Alley, one of our Company per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, with the light of his Tapers, that one of the holes open'd a pa≈ø≈øage to another Cave; which cau≈øed us to ≈øee whether there was not there any thing worthy of our notice: Though the hole was but ≈ømall and narrow, we crept in upon our Bellies with our lighted Tapers; and one after another we came to the other ≈øide, where we ≈øound one of the ≈øtrange≈øt and mo≈øt curious Caves that we had ever ≈øeen: It was greater, more compleat, and cleaner than any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; built long and ≈øquare, and well Plai≈øter'd with Lime; at each ≈øide of the Wall, which is the main Rock, there are three ranks of holes, like to tho≈øe that we had ≈øeen in the former: In the longer ≈øides were fifteen in every rank, plac'd one a top of the other; in all they were forty-five. The two ends, or ≈øides, that were ≈øhorte≈øt, had likewi≈øe three ranks, and three holes at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very rank, nine in all. They were all empty and clean, and no ill ≈øcent in all the Cave; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs it be in one hole, where we ≈øaw the Skeleton of the Body of a Man dried up.</p>
                  <p>I conceive that the Learned may de≈øire my judgment concerning the≈øe Caves and Holes, and to what purpo≈øe they were made. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, that it is not ea≈øie to give a ju≈øt account of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106091:61"/>them; becau≈øe <hi>Macrizi,</hi> who hath ≈øpoken of all the remarkable things of <hi>Egypt,</hi> makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the≈øe Caves: Neverthele≈øs it is ea≈øie to be ≈øeen, that they could be for no other u≈øe, but to bury and place the dead. This may be gathered from the fa≈øhion of the holes, which are ju≈øt as long as high, and as large as needs mu≈øt to place a Bier or Coffin; be≈øides, all the other Caves in <hi>Egypt</hi> were only for that purpo≈øe: it is therefore very probable that this was for no other purpo≈øe, let the Reader think what he plea≈øeth of them.</p>
                  <p>I do not deny but that they may have ≈øerv'd the Chri≈øtians to meet together, and pray God in ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, for fear of the Heathens that per≈øecuted them. I find this Opinion in <hi>Seid ibn Patrik,</hi> a Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his Hi≈øtory, <hi>p.</hi> 399.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Alexandria</hi> name the≈øe Caves the
<hi>S√∫k,</hi> or the Market-place; but there is no likelihood that they have been employed for that u≈øe.</p>
                  <p>The Rock in which they are cut, is much eaten and con≈øum'd by time; the holes are likewi≈øe much decayed, chiefly tho≈øe that are neare≈øt to the Door, and in the open air: They receive ≈øome light from above, through little ≈øquare holes that are made on purpo≈øe in the Vaults.</p>
                  <p>The 22th I went round the City, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Walls and Towers. I went into ≈øix of the chief: The fir≈øt is that which is neare≈øt to the <hi>French Fondego,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Hou≈øe, before you come to
<hi>Bab il achdar,</hi> or <hi>the green Gate.</hi> It is round, and ≈øupported within with three ranks of Pillars of red Stone, ≈øeven in every one.</p>
                  <p>Next to this Tower, we went to the Gate of the old Haven, which at pre≈øent is walled in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe <pb n="115" facs="tcp:106091:61"/>this Haven is not frequented: both are at the <hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide of the City. From this Gate we went to the <hi>Mo≈øque</hi> of the ≈øeventy, called <hi>Giama il garbis.</hi> We went next by the old Ca≈øtle of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> named
<hi>Borg Mu≈øtapha Pacha,</hi> which ≈øerv'd heretofore to guard the old Haven; at pre≈øent there are three hundred <hi>Jani≈ø≈øaries</hi> in Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon.</p>
                  <p>Till then we walk'd always towards the <hi>We≈øt;</hi> but when we had left this Ca≈øtle, we turn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Ea≈øt,</hi> and found next a great Tower; where we got upon the Platform, not by any ≈øteps, but by a large way made ≈øloping up.</p>
                  <p>Next to this Tower, we came to <hi>Bab i≈ø≈øidr,</hi> out of which ≈øtands the Pillar of <hi>Pompey:</hi> From thence we went to another, called <hi>Bab irra≈øc√Æd,</hi> or <hi>the Gate of Ro≈øetta,</hi> along the Walls of the City. I went out of the City, alone with the
<hi>Jani≈ø≈øary,</hi> to ≈øee where the River <hi>Nilus</hi> goes into the Channel which an≈øwers to the Ci≈øterns of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which I ≈øhall de≈øcribe hereafter.</p>
                  <p>When I had fully viewed that which I de≈øired, I returned into the Town to my company, that waited for me in the ≈øhade; and all together we walk'd to the Tower of the <hi>Indians,</hi> ≈øo called, becau≈øe of late there lodges ≈øome <hi>Indian</hi> Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims. We went into it, and found its make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry admirable.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <p>We went next to the Tower of the old Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtom-hou≈øe, or
<hi>Douane;</hi> ≈øo nam'd, becau≈øe when the Sea came to the Walls: of the City on that ≈øide, the Store-hou≈øes of the Cu≈øtoms were there: But ≈øince the Sea is gone from thence, the Gate is ≈øhut, and the Cu≈øtom-hou≈øe is establi≈øh'd and ≈øettled in another place.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:106091:62"/>
                  <p>This Tower is very big, ≈øupported within with four ranks of Pillars of red Stone. Here are many Rooms fit for ≈øtores, for lodgings, and to put Salt in, though much of it is now ruinated. This was the la≈øt Tower that we ≈øaw in our Walk, which continued four hours, reckoning the time that we ≈øpent in viewing the Walls, and climbing up to the Towers.</p>
                  <p>I return at pre≈øent to the Channel, by which the Ci≈øterns are furni≈øh'd with Water.</p>
                  <p>It is out of the Gate of <hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> about ≈øix Foot high, vaulted in the in≈øide, about a quarter of a Mile from the City: It joins to the <hi>Calitz</hi> of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> that furni≈øhes it with Water from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nilus;</hi> from thence the Water runs to the Walls, where it meets with another Conduit not fat from this Gate; which Conduit, or Channel, is made ≈øo ingeniou≈øly, that it furni≈øhes all the Ci≈øterns of the City with Water.</p>
                  <p>We mu≈øt al≈øo take notice, that though the Mouth of this Channel is as high as the re≈øt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt the two thirds are wall'd from the top to the bottom; ≈øo that there remains but a ≈ømall hole where the Waters of the <hi>Calitz</hi> flow in, as through a Window. And becau≈øe they are very ≈øalt the fir≈øt three days, and they would fill the Ci≈øterns with ≈ølime and filth, if the Water did enter in at that time freely: To prevent this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency, they that have the care of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øtop this hole, and leave it ≈øo three days; which being ended, they go to the entry of the Channel, followed by a crowd of People, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtop the hole, and let in the Water to fill the Ci≈øterns. This day is a day of great rejoicing all over the City.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:106091:62"/>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Alexandria</hi> hath ≈øix Gates; three are open, namely that towards the <hi>South,</hi> called <hi>Bab i≈ø≈øidr;</hi> that which is at the <hi>Ea≈øt,</hi> named <hi>Bab irra≈øc√Æd,</hi> or
<hi>the Gate of Ro≈øetta;</hi> that which looks to the <hi>North-Ea≈øt,</hi> and is named the Sea-Gate. The three Gates that are ≈øhut are, that of the old Cu≈øtom-hou≈øe; the green Gate, called by the <hi>Arabs, Bab il achdar;</hi> and that of the old Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>I cannot po≈øitively affirm whether the Walls and the Gates that are now there, be tho≈øe that <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> caus'd to be builded, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Califfs</hi> have made them. I imagin that the
<hi>Califfs</hi> have erected them, and not <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> (though many Travellers are of a contrary opinion.) Becau≈øe there is no <hi>Greek</hi> In≈øcriptions to be ≈øeen, but all <hi>Arab..</hi> Some are written in ≈øtrange Characters, others in the ordinary <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Character. The≈øe In≈øcriptions ≈øpeak of the <hi>Califf,</hi> and Year when they were builded, or re-edified. The Gates being high where the≈øe In≈øcriptions were graven, and the Letters arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially put with other works, I could not di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh nor read them. 2. The manner of their building proves this truth; for they are builded as the Gates of <hi>Cairo,</hi> which were the work of the <hi>Califfs,</hi> who have been there many Ages after <hi>Alexander the Great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two Havens in <hi>Alexandria;</hi> the one called the old Haven, where Ships enter in with the <hi>We≈øterly</hi> Wind; but now it is of no u≈øe, but to ≈øecure the Ve≈ø≈øels that ≈øail from the
<hi>Ea≈øt</hi> towards the <hi>We≈øt,</hi> when the bad Weather obliges them to ≈øeek for ≈øhelter. The other is called the new Haven; there all the Ships arrive, <pb n="118" facs="tcp:106091:63"/>and where they now ca≈øt Anchor.</p>
                  <p>The Trade of the <hi>French</hi> Merchants in this City, is the greate≈øt that they have in all the <hi>Ea≈øtern</hi> Parts; for there is no place in <hi>Turkie</hi> where ≈øo many <hi>French</hi> Ships come as into this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; from the beginning of the Year 1672, to the Month of
<hi>June,</hi> there was no le≈øs than nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>French</hi> Ships that came hither; and in the Month of <hi>June</hi> I reckoned fourteen.</p>
                  <p>This is a con≈øiderable number, but not to be compar'd with the number of Ve≈ø≈øels that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented this Haven heretofore: For Mon≈øieur
<hi>Luca≈øole,</hi> that did the Office of Chancellor of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, told me that he remembers that there have been at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in one Year, ninety-four <hi>French</hi> Ships.</p>

<hi>Reus Ahmed il Curdi,</hi> a Man very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the
<hi>Francs,</hi> to go with him to <pb n="130" facs="tcp:106091:69"/>
                     <hi>Tarane,</hi> or
<hi>Terenut,</hi> as the <hi>Copties</hi> call it in their Dictionary. It is a little Village in the <hi>Ca≈øcieflik</hi> of <hi>Beheire,</hi> four and twenty hours travelling from <hi>Cairo,</hi> ≈øcituate upon the
<hi>Ea≈øt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> the place where Men commonly go a-≈øhore when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign to travel to tho≈øe Mona≈øteries. But, before I came to that Village, I received many affronts from ≈øome young <hi>Turks,</hi> becau≈øe I carried with me a little Box full of Wine. A zealous <hi>Cadi</hi> being troubled in Con≈øcience for being in the company of a <hi>Franc</hi> that drunk Wine, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd them to ask me ≈øome, that he might have an occa≈øion to quarrel with me, if I did give them ≈øome. The≈øe Rogues having the Authority of a <hi>Cadi</hi> to countenance their wicked de≈øign, four of the bolde≈øt ask'd me ≈øome very earne≈øtly; for they ≈øaid they knew that I had ≈øome. I excus'd my ≈øelf at fir≈øt, that I could not give them any to drink, becau≈øe they were not to drink Wine; and that I knew very well that it was a great Crime for a <hi>Franc</hi> to give Wine to a <hi>Mu≈øulman,</hi> chiefly in a place where many others would be offended at it, and that ≈øuch an action might bring me into trouble. But all the≈øe rea≈øons could not prevail; they would have ≈øome <hi>Volens Nolens,</hi> threatning that if I denied them they would ca≈øt my Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River. When I ≈øaw my ≈øelf in this danger, I intreated the <hi>Reus,</hi> unto whom I was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Vice-Con≈øul of <hi>Ro≈øetta,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me. He did ≈øo much by his credit, that he pacified them for that time.</p>
                  <p>At my arrival at <hi>Tarane,</hi> whither I was to go a-≈øhore, I hired in the Morning a little Boat to carry me, and my Cloaths and Provi≈øions, to the Village; for our Ve≈ø≈øel was great and well loaden,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106091:69"/>and could not at that time go near the ≈øhore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Water was not deep. Three of the≈øe <hi>Turks</hi> ca≈øt them≈øelves furiou≈øly into my Boat, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my Box in earne≈øt to ca≈øt it into the River. I ≈ønatch'd it from them, and run to my Mu≈øquet as if I intended to ≈øhoot at them: my <hi>Black-a-moor</hi> likewi≈øe, who was couragious, took one by the Neck and ca≈øt him into the River, and with his Sword in his Hand put him≈øelf in a po≈øture of defence; When they ≈øaw that they had to do with Men of courage that were not afraid of them, they went back into the Barque, and very furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly a≈ø≈øaulted the <hi>Reus</hi> with their Fi≈øts; be≈øides, they accus'd him, as he him≈øelf told me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, at his return to <hi>Cairo,</hi> before his <hi>Aga,</hi> to have drank Wine with a <hi>Franc,</hi> making him pay, as a puni≈øhment, ten
<hi>Pia≈øters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Rencounter, I had another Accident that happen'd to me, far more grievous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. At my landing I wanted a Man to carry my Cloaths to the Hou≈øe where I intended to lodge; I called therefore ≈øome of the <hi>Arabians</hi> that were newly arriv'd from the De≈øarts of S.
<hi>Macarius</hi> with <hi>Nitre,</hi> or <hi>Salt-Peter:</hi> He that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried my Box of Wine finding it to be very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and knowing not what was in it, he thought it had been a Box of Money; therefore being proud of his burden, he told all that he met with in the way, that he carry'd a Box full of Money, that belong'd to a <hi>Franc</hi> newly arriv'd, that was going to the Mona≈øteries. This lye ≈øpread about the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and was believ'd as true, ≈øo that I was in no ≈ømall danger; for there was no other talk in the Town but of the rich <hi>Franc</hi> that was there, and of the means to get his Money: They thought I had <pb n="132" facs="tcp:106091:70"/>been ≈øome Con≈øul that travell'd <hi>incognito</hi> to ≈øee the Country, therefore they re≈øolv'd to wait for me in the way, and to take from me all my Trea≈øure.</p>
                  <p>In this manner I landed at <hi>Tarane,</hi> on a
<hi>Sunday,</hi> and went to lodge at a poor Carpenters Hou≈øe, a Chri≈øtian
<hi>Coptie,</hi> the only Chri≈øtian in that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; he allowed me for my Chamber, a place where he put Straw for his Bea≈øts; it was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Faggots of Palm-trees, heap'd one upon another, to hinder the heats of the Sun: I found there two religious Per≈øons of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteries whither I intended to go, with them I pa≈øt my fears and apprehen≈øions.</p>
                  <p>When I under≈øtood, from all hands, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiracy that the
<hi>Arabians</hi> had form'd again≈øt me; the danger oblig'd me the the next day, to de≈øire the <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> of that place to give me a Guard, to bring me ≈øafe to the Mona≈øteries; and that I might per≈øwade him the ≈øooner, I gave him ≈øome Pounds of Coffee and Loaves of Sugar, which I had brought with me for that purpo≈øe; for it is the Cu≈øtom in <hi>Turkie,</hi> when a favour is de≈øired from a <hi>Turk,</hi> to begin with Gifts: But the
<hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> having heard what report went of me, an≈øwer'd me, that a ≈ømall Guard would do me but little good, becau≈øe the <hi>Arabians</hi> had formed a de≈øign to wait for me in the way, and to cut my Throat, and that it was needful that he ≈øhould Guard me him≈øelf; which he promis'd to do within a few days, after that he had fini≈øh'd ≈øome bu≈øine≈øs of importance.</p>
                  <p>I was mightily troubled when I heard what the <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> offer'd me. It was to no purpo≈øe when I told him that I was no Con≈øul, as the report went of me without any colour of truth, but rather a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106091:70"/>poor <hi>Franc</hi> that went to the Mona≈øteries to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect my ≈øelf in the Language of the Country; That in this Box there was no Money, but only ≈øome Gla≈øs Bottles of Wine which I carried with me, becau≈øe I was never us'd to drink Water. All this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe was to no purpo≈øe, he was ≈øo prepo≈ø≈øe≈øs'd with the fal≈øe report that I could not be believ'd. When I ≈øaw that I ≈øpent my labour in vain, I went to my Lodging without accepting his offer.</p>
                  <p>At that time I had news that <hi>Na≈ø≈ør All√°,</hi> an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of one of the Mona≈øteries, that I intended to vi≈øit, was at a Village at the other ≈øide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, call'd <hi>Tuh ine≈ø≈ø√°ra,</hi> not far from <hi>Tarane</hi> down the Current, about ≈øome concerns of his Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery. I ≈øent him a Letter, written in
<hi>Arabic,</hi> by one of the Lay Monks whom I found at my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at
<hi>Tarane,</hi> acquainting him with my intention, and all that had happen'd between me and the <hi>Ca≈øcief,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> intreating him to tell me how I ≈øhould get free from tho≈øe People; I a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øur'd him that I ≈øhould be for ever oblig'd to him, and that all the favour he ≈øhould ≈øhew me would be plea≈øing to his Partriarch, who was my very good Friend, and had recommended me to the Governours of tho≈øe Mona≈øteries. But this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil Abbot was ≈øo far from an≈øwering to my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I expected, that he kept with him the Me≈ø≈øenger, and would not ≈øuffer him to return back.</p>
                  <p>When I ≈øaw the Abbots incivility, and being more de≈øirous to proceed on in my Journy, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding all the≈øe difficulties; I re≈øolved once more to vi≈øit the <hi>Ca≈øcief,</hi> to intreat him to give me a Guard, thinking to find him of another judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he was before when I ≈øaw him fir≈øt, but <pb n="134" facs="tcp:106091:71"/>I receiv'd from him the ≈øame an≈øwer; He told me that he would not have me venture, unle≈øs he Guarded me him≈øelf; that he mu≈øt an≈øwer to the <hi>Pacha</hi> for my Life, if any mi≈øchance did happen to me in my Journy, and that he knew that I was but ill accommodated with the Chri≈øtian; he de≈øired me therefore to take a Chamber at his Hou≈øe. I mu≈øt confe≈øs that this ≈øecond offer, as well as the fir≈øt, did ≈øtrangely trouble me: for this earne≈øt de≈øire that he did di≈øcover of Guarding me in his own Per≈øon, was no good Omen to me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, his Reputation was but bad in the Village; and when I ≈øhould have had no rea≈øon to fear him, and that his intentions had been very good, the expences I mu≈øt have been at for him and his Company, and the Gifts that I mu≈øt have be≈øtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him for his pains, would have ruined me; for I knew that a <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> never ventures out in a Journy without a great train of Hor≈øe and Foot, and without expecting great matters.</p>
                  <p>When I ≈øaw the danger and trouble that I had in this Journy, I re≈øolved to return to <hi>Cairo</hi> as ≈øoon as I could. With this re≈øolution I ≈øpent the re≈øt of the day in my Lodging, thinking how I might be able to compa≈øs it. About two hours in the Night I heard knocking at the Door very earne≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and becau≈øe it was no ≈øea≈øonable time to ≈øpeak with me, and that the Per≈øon knockt very hard, I began to think that I was in danger: That I might not be ≈øurpriz'd, I awak'd the Per≈øons in the Hou≈øe, and took my Weapons in my hand, ≈øending my <hi>Black-a-moor</hi> to ≈øee who was there; he return'd to me, and told me that it was a Groom of the
<hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> that was de≈øirous to ≈øpeak with me, concerning a bu≈øine≈øs of the highe≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. <pb n="135" facs="tcp:106091:71"/>I caus'd him to come in, and found that it was he that had introduc'd me to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters pre≈øence, unto whom I had made ≈øome ≈ømall Gifts: As ≈øoon as he ≈øaw me, he intreated me by his Religion and mine, as the Cu≈øtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is, to go away immediately, as ≈øecretly as I could; for his Ma≈øter intended to kill me, becau≈øe he thought I was a Man that travell'd up and down only to ≈øeek for the Trea≈øures of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Egyptians:</hi> And that he might more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently perform this bloody de≈øign, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to lead me him≈øelf towards the Mona≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the middle of the Wilderne≈øs, where he would ≈øuffer me to re≈øt, and afterwards cut my Throat: And if afterwards any ≈øhould inquire for a <hi>Franc</hi> that was gone by
<hi>Tarane</hi> to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteries, he would ≈øay that he is gone to
<hi>Cairo</hi> by another way: He told me al≈øo, that about a Month before that, his Ma≈øter had kill'd a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> Traveller of
<hi>Barbary,</hi> and had ca≈øt his Body into the River, for the ≈øame cau≈øe.</p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as I under≈øtood this bad news, I had no more mind to ≈øleep, I gave him the reward that he had de≈øerv'd, and ≈øent to ≈øeek a Camel to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my Cloaths; and about one of the Clock in the Night I departed to go to the pa≈ø≈øage that leads to <hi>Giz√©y,</hi> a Village ≈øcituated on the other ≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> about an hour and a halfs travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from <hi>Tarane</hi> down the Water: I agreed there with a Ma≈øter of a Boat to carry me and my Cloaths over; and about break of the Day I went aboard very ≈øpeedily: As ≈øoon as we were lanch'd into the River, from Land, I ≈øaw the <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> galloping towards us with about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men on Hor≈øe back to catch me; but he <pb n="136" facs="tcp:106091:72"/>mi≈øs'd of his intent, for I was out of his reach.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Giz√©y,</hi> as I was waiting for an opportunity to return to <hi>Cairo,</hi> the Abbot <hi>Na≈ø≈ør alla,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before, came thither and offer'd to conduct me to the Mona≈øteries, if I would return to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane</hi> in his company; but I had no mind any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to vi≈øit them.</p>
                  <p>I went from <hi>Giz√©y</hi> the ≈øame day, being
<hi>Fryday,</hi> towards <hi>Cairo;</hi> and the next Night we lodg'd at
<hi>Verdan,</hi> a Village ≈øcituate on the <hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide of
<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> not far from <hi>Boulak;</hi> and on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 9th of <hi>July,</hi> I enter'd into <hi>Cairo,</hi> from whence I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the
7th of <hi>June.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whil≈øt I was at <hi>Tarane,</hi> the <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi>'s Clark, who was a <hi>Coptie</hi> and a Chri≈øtian, came to ≈øee me ≈øometimes. I under≈øtood from him what the Lakes of <hi>Salt-Peter,</hi> or
<hi>Niter,</hi> yield to the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi> every Year. He told me, that this Year within the ≈øpace of nine Months, they had drawn four and twenty thou≈øand <hi>Quintals,</hi> and that they mu≈øt take up twelve thou≈øand more to make up the ordinary Sum that is drawn: So that every
<hi>Quintal</hi> being ≈øold for 25 <hi>Meidins,</hi> this Revenue comes to 36 Pur≈øes, or 18000 Crowns, <hi>French</hi> Money, by the Year.</p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as it is taken out of the Lakes they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it upon Camels to <hi>Tarane,</hi> where it is weighed, and from thence ≈øent to
<hi>Cairo,</hi> or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to be ≈øold.</p>
                  <p>For this cau≈øe a <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> dwells here, who though he be but little in Authority, and ≈øubject to the <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> of
<hi>Beheire,</hi> he is forc'd to buy this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and pay for it four and twenty Pur≈øes; one half to the <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> of <hi>Beheire,</hi> and the other half to the <hi>Pacha:</hi> he keeps al≈øo twenty <hi>Spahins</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:106091:72"/>to wait upon him, and guard his Country; he is the Lord of the≈øe Mona≈øteries.</p>
                  <p>But before I proceed on in my Journal, I will give a ≈øhort account of ≈øome remarkable things in this De≈øart, as I have heard them from one that hath been an Abbot in one of the Mona≈øteries.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt there is to be ≈øeen, between the Mona≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of S.
<hi>Macarius,</hi> and of <hi>Amba Bi≈øcioi,</hi> and a little further in the Wilderne≈øs, a long rank of little heaps of Earth, a Foot from one another, plac'd as in a way; which, as the Monks ≈øay, was put there by the Angels, that the Hermites might be able to find the way to the Church when they were de≈øirous to hear Divine Service on <hi>Sundays;</hi> for before they were apt to go out of the way: Therefore this way is called now, <hi>Tarik il mel√°ike,</hi> or, <hi>The way of Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly I have under≈øtood from an old Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcript in
<hi>Arab.</hi> that in the Wilderne≈øs were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ≈øeven great Mona≈øteries; namely, 1. of S. <hi>Macarius;</hi> 2. Of S. <hi>John the little,</hi> ≈øirnamed <hi>Igum√®ne;</hi> 3. Of <hi>Amba Bi≈øc√≠oi;</hi> 4. Of S. <hi>Ma≈ø≈øine,</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;</hi> 5. That of <hi>Amba Mo≈øes,</hi> ≈øirnamed <hi>Black;</hi> 6. That of <hi>Amba K√©ma;</hi> 7. That of the holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of <hi>Syria:</hi> and that be≈øides the≈øe ≈øeven Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteries, there were three hundred dwellings of Hermites, and ≈øolitary People that ≈øerved God in this Wilderne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>But now, of all the≈øe Mona≈øteries, there are but two remarkable; namely, the Mona≈øtery of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and that of
<hi>Amba Bi≈øcioi.</hi> They are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh'd with very good Water. The fir≈øt hath two Churches; one for the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and another for the
<hi>Copties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that of the <hi>Syrians</hi> is to be ≈øeen a miraculous
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106091:73"/>Tree, growing from the Staff of S. <hi>Ephrem.</hi> This holy Man left it at the Gate when he went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øit one in the Mona≈øtery, and immediately it ≈øhot forth Roots downwards, and Leaves upwards, with Flowers. They ≈øay, that there is no ≈øuch Tree to be found in all
<hi>Egypt</hi> be≈øides.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the Mona≈øtery of S. <hi>John the little,</hi> which now is much decayed, is to be ≈øeen a Tree that grew likewi≈øe from this Saints Staff miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øly, when he had fix'd it into the Ground at his Superiors command, and water'd it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they call it, becau≈øe of this Act of Obedience, <hi>Scieigiaret itt√°a,</hi> or <hi>the Tree of Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the way that leads from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na≈øtery of the
<hi>Syrians</hi> to the Mountain of the Eagles Stones, is to be ≈øeen the Bed of <hi>Bahr Bel√° me,</hi> or River without Water; which was dried up, as the Monks relate, at the Prayers of the ancient Hermites that dwelt about its Banks; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they were grievou≈øly troubled by the Pyrats that ≈øailed upon it, therefore they obtain'd from God this favour.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in this De≈øart is to be ≈øeen another Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio≈øity, call'd by the <hi>Arabians, Lahm iggi√∫f;</hi> but becau≈øe I could not well under≈øtand what it was, I could de≈øire that ≈øome other Traveller would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it out, that we may better know what to think of it.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>A Walk to the Garden of <hi>Ma-T√°rea.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE 12th of <hi>July</hi> I went, in the Company of ≈øome
<hi>French</hi> Merchants, to the Village of <hi>Ma-T√°rea,</hi> ≈øcituate on the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> about <pb n="139" facs="tcp:106091:73"/>two hours riding on Hor≈øe-back, to vi≈øit the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which Chri≈øt and his mo≈øt holy Mother have ≈øanctified with their abode, and the Garden where the Balm Plants were ≈øet formerly.</p>
                  <p>At the entry into the Court which is before this Garden there is to be ≈øeen, at the right hand, a ≈ømall Oratory of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which one <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> who was <hi>Pacha</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> about thirteen years ago, caus'd to be built out of a hatred of the <hi>Copties,</hi> upon the ruins of a Church which belong'd to them, and where they reverenc'd ≈øome Relicks and ≈øteps of our Lord, and of his mo≈øt holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Pacha</hi> chang'd, as we have ≈øaid, this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel into an Oratory of <hi>Turks,</hi> that no Chri≈øtian might have the liberty to enter in and vi≈øit it. But ≈øince the <hi>Turks</hi> have for≈øaken it one may go in freely without hindrance; therefore it is no longer named an Oratory, but <hi>il M√°kad,</hi> or <hi>the place of re≈øt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>M√°kad</hi> is a little Ci≈øtern of Marble of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours, full of Water, which comes into it by a Channel from the miraculous Well that is near by. The <hi>Copties</hi> ≈øay, from Tradition, that the ble≈ø≈øed Virgin was wont to wa≈øh in it the Linen of her divine Son; and that whil≈øt ≈øhe was employed in working, ≈øhe laid him in a little hole which is in the Wall of the <hi>M√°kad,</hi> a place where ≈øome reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Francs</hi> have heretofore ≈øaid Ma≈øs, out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                  <p>However it be, I will not deny a Tradition ≈øo ancient; but it is ≈øo hard to reconcile all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances which they bring to prove it, that when I had done all that I could to under≈øtand the truth, I ≈øound ≈øuch doubts as did rather <pb n="140" facs="tcp:106091:74"/>contradict, than e≈øtabli≈øh any ≈øuch thing.</p>
                  <p>Very near this <hi>M√°kad,</hi> or re≈øting place, is the miraculous Well, very deep. Its Waters are lighter and ≈øweeter than the Waters of <hi>Nilus.</hi> This is ≈øo well known, that the <hi>Pacha</hi>'s drink of it, and prefer it to the Waters of the River.</p>
                  <p>The Tradition of the <hi>Copties</hi> ≈øay, and ≈øome
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Hi≈øtorians agree to it, as <hi>Amru ibn il verdi,</hi> that our Saviour hath wa≈øh'd him≈øelf in this Well, and by a Miracle he hath given this ≈øweetne≈øs, and extraordinary plea≈øantne≈øs to the≈øe Waters.</p>
                  <p>Its Sour≈øe, or Spring, is not well known. Some think that it came by a Miracle, others ≈øay that it proceeds from <hi>Nilus</hi> under ground. But I think it impo≈ø≈øible; 1. Becau≈øe of the great di≈øtance between the River and this Well; 2. Becau≈øe when the Waters of <hi>Nilus</hi> are corrupt and thick, the Water of this Well is clear, whereas if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of the River, it would be as thick as the Waters of
<hi>Nilus;</hi> 3. becau≈øe the Water of this Well never ri≈øeth, nor falls, as the River doth, but is always equal in height; finally I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, from the name given to it, <hi>M√°-Tarea,</hi> which ≈øignifies fre≈øh Water; this ≈øignifies that it hath a particular Sour≈øe, and a quality not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Waters of <hi>Nilus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mahometans</hi> ≈øay, that it proceeds from the Well
<hi>Bir i≈ø≈øim≈øim,</hi> which is at <hi>Mecha;</hi> a famous Well, becau≈øe of a pretended Miracle of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi> But this is a Fable invented by ≈øome of their <hi>Sciechs,</hi> to obtain more credit to their Prophet; for <hi>Mecha</hi> is di≈øtant from <hi>Cairo</hi> one and thirty days journy, as the <hi>Caravan</hi> makes them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is impo≈ø≈øible that a Well ≈øhould be in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> 
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:106091:74"/>proceeding from a Sour≈øe at ≈øuch a di≈øtance.</p>
                  <p>After that we had eaten in the re≈øting place, and drank of this good Water out of devotion, we went into the Garden, where heretofore the Balm trees were Planted, which yielded Balm on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they ≈øtood in this place, and were watered with the Water of the miraculous Well. One may read my Book upon this Subject, called <hi>The Church of Alexandria;</hi> where many remarkable things may be found, very curious, concerning the≈øe Trees and this Well.</p>
                  <p>In this Garden was heretofore to be ≈øeen the Sicamore-tree, which, as the <hi>Copties</hi> ≈øay, ≈øplit in two miraculou≈øly, to hide our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt and his mo≈øt holy Mother, when the Souldiers of
<hi>Herod</hi> pur≈øued him: They ≈øay, that when they hid them≈øelves in this opening of the Sicamore, they ≈øaved them≈øelves from the Souldiers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, by the favour of a Spiders Web that cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ≈øuddenly, and appeared very old, though it was made in an in≈øtant by a Miracle: ≈øo that that they imagin'd not that any Per≈øon could be hid within, much le≈øs the Per≈øons whom they were ≈øeeking.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Franci≈øcans</hi> of the Holy Land, that dwell at
<hi>Cairo,</hi> di≈øpute with the Keepers of this Garden, the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of this Tree; and ≈øay, that it fell down with old age in the year 1656. and that they gather'd then up the pieces which they keep carefully in their place of Relicks; I have ≈øeen them there. The Gardiners yet ≈øhew in this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a Stump which I have ≈øeen, which they ≈øay are the remains of this Sicamore. But this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute concerns me not much, neither do I think that I ≈øhould oblige tho≈øe Fathers to maintain
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106091:75"/>their intere≈øt in this ca≈øe that is ≈øo trivial.</p>
                  <p>When we had ≈øeen this Sicamore, we went out of the Garden to ≈øee the Needle, which is out of the Village, planted in the open Field, where ≈øtood anciently the City <hi>Heliopolis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Needle is not equally ≈øquare, for there are two ≈øides larger than the others: The large≈øt are each of ≈øix Foot, and the narrowe≈øt of five and a half. There be but few Characters graven upon it, but they be yet to be read; and tho≈øe that are graven in one ≈øide, are al≈øo in the three others. It is of a red Stone, as all other Needles that I have ≈øeen in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Planted upon the ground without any Ba≈øis to ≈øtand upon.</p>
                  <p>Near this Needle is a ≈øquare Stone of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary bigne≈øs, which ≈øeems to have been the Ba≈øis of ≈øome great Pillar; but it is worn on the ≈øides, therefore I neglected to take the mea≈øure of it.</p>
                  <p>In this Field <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> encamp'd with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when he engaged in a Fight with <hi>Sultan Cajed Bey,</hi> the la≈øt King of the <hi>Mammelucs;</hi> ≈øome of the Trenches of his Camp are yet to be ≈øeen.</p>
                  <p>I went next alone from <hi>M√°-Tarea</hi> to
<hi>M√≠nied Sored,</hi> another Village hard by on the
<hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide, to ≈øee a miraculous Image of the ble≈ø≈øed Virgin, which the <hi>Copties</hi> keep in their Church; of which I have read a Miracle in an <hi>Aby≈ø≈øin</hi> Manu≈øcript, which I found in the Mona≈øtery of
<hi>Koskam,</hi> near <hi>Momfallot</hi> in the middle <hi>Egypt,</hi> at my fir≈øt Voyage into <hi>Egypt.</hi> As ≈øoon as I had ≈øeen it, I return'd to
<hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 17th of <hi>July, Saturday</hi> Night, I went to the Mona≈øtery of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> ≈øcituated out of the Old <hi>Cairo</hi> at the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide, about half an hours <pb n="143" facs="tcp:106091:75"/>riding on Hor≈øe-back, in the Field called, in <hi>Arab. Birket ≈øiech Ombarek,</hi> or the Lake of the ble≈ø≈øed <hi>Sciech;</hi> where I ≈øpent the Night to hear Ma≈øs; for the <hi>Copties</hi> ≈øay it ordinarily after Midnight.</p>
                  <p>The next day I return'd back to my Lodging, and ≈øaw in my pa≈ø≈øage all the Churches and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteries of the <hi>Copties</hi> which are in Old <hi>Cairo;</hi> leaving on our left hand the three Churches which are in <hi>Babylon Ma≈ø≈ør,</hi> which was heretofore part of Old
<hi>Cairo,</hi> but is now totally de≈øtroyed. I began my vi≈øit by the Churches that are in <hi>Ca≈ø≈ør I≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c√©mma.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE fir≈øt was that of <hi>Ma√°llaca:</hi> It is a very ancient Church, ≈øtately and very clear; and I may ≈øay that it is the mo≈øt beautiful that the <hi>Copties</hi> have in <hi>Egypt.</hi> It is the Metropolis in which the Patriarch performs his fir≈øt Divine Service.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> bought it of <hi>Amru ibn il A≈ø≈ø,</hi> as may appear by the Contract written upon the Walls of this Church with the Hand of this Prince, who cur≈øeth there all the <hi>Mahometans</hi> that ≈øhall offer to take it from them.</p>
                  <p>There be five <hi>Heikels,</hi> or Chappels, in a rank; but ≈øeparated the one from the other with little Grates of Wood: ≈øo that five Ma≈ø≈øes may be read at once, and the Prie≈øts need not interrupt one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                  <p>At the entry of this Church a little Image is to be ≈øeen, at the right hand, upon one of the Pillars: which Image, the <hi>Copties</hi> ≈øay, ≈øpoke to S. <hi>Ephrem,</hi> 
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:106091:76"/>one of their Patriarchs, to comfort him in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, when <hi>Me√©z le din alla,</hi> the <hi>Califf,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to tran≈øport Mount <hi>Gebel il moc√°ttam,</hi> which now ≈øtands behind the Ca≈øtle of
<hi>Cairo,</hi> from one place to another, to prove the truth of his Religion; becau≈øe our Saviour Chri≈øt ≈øaith in the Go≈øpel, <hi>If you had faith as a Grain of Mu≈øtard-≈øeed, you ≈øhould ≈øay to this Mountain, remove thence to yonder place, and it ≈øhall remove; and nothing ≈øhall be impo≈ø≈øible unto you.</hi> He threatned him therefore that if he did not remove it, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy all his Nation, as a People that profe≈ø≈øed a fal≈øe Religion, and that de≈øerved not to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them that were Believers. Becau≈øe this Image ≈øpoke then to their Patriarch, to comfort him and a≈ø≈øure him that he ≈øhould remove the Mountain in ≈øpight of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who had anger'd this <hi>Califf</hi> again≈øt them, they highly re≈øpect it.</p>
                  <p>Next to <hi>Ma√°llaca,</hi> I went to vi≈øit <hi>Sancta Barba;</hi> where, as my leader told me, the Body of this Saint re≈øts at the left hand of the Chappel. This Church is great and very light, and therefore ≈øeems to me to be the mo≈øt plea≈øant of all the re≈øt. There be al≈øo three Chappels in a rank.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øaw next the Church of Saint <hi>Sergius,</hi> which was built, as <hi>Said ibn Patrik</hi> ≈øaith in his Hi≈øtory, by a
<hi>Coptie,</hi> a Secretary to <hi>Abd ilaziz ibn Meru√°n,</hi> a
<hi>Califf</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under this Church is to be ≈øeen a Cave, in which, as the
<hi>Copties</hi> hold by Tradition, Chri≈øt with his mo≈øt ble≈ø≈øed Mother have lived a while. It is divided into three Angles, or Parts, by little Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. In the fir≈øt, at the entrance, is the Bapti≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Font of the
<hi>Copties:</hi> At the bottom of the middle ≈øeparation is a place in the Wall, and in <pb n="145" facs="tcp:106091:76"/>this place a Stone, which, as the
<hi>Copties</hi> believe, hath been ≈øanctified with the ≈øteps of our ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed Saviour. The religious <hi>Francs</hi> ≈øometimes ≈øay Ma≈øs here. In the third ≈øeparation is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stone ≈øanctified al≈øo by our Saviour's foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteps.</p>
                  <p>In the Cave, I remember not well in which ≈øeparation, is to be ≈øeen the Epitaph of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Europe,</hi> buried there about two hundred and ≈øeventy five years ago, in <hi>Gothick</hi> Letters; but the Stone is plac'd up≈øide-down, through the ignorance of the Ma≈øon, as I believe; this is the Epitaph.
<q>Hic jacet Nobilis Petrus Louys IX. Neapollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, qui obiit M.CCCC.II. die. XI. Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arii.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next to this Church, I vi≈øited that of our ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed Lady, in the Street called <hi>Darb itt√°ka.</hi> It is very ≈ømall, and very ob≈øcure. Out of this Church I ≈øaw a little round Stone of black Marble, lying upon the ground; about it were graven ≈ømall Hieroglyphick Letters.</p>
                  <p>At a little di≈øtance from this Church, through an Alley, is to be ≈øeen the remains of a <hi>Per≈øian</hi> Temple, called in <hi>Arab. Kobbet il fors,</hi> or <hi>the Temple of the Per≈øians,</hi> which
<hi>Artaxerxes Ochus,</hi> King of <hi>Per≈øia,</hi> caus'd to be built in honour of the Fire; and though the Ruines are but ≈ømall, they di≈øcover yet that this Temple was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very ≈øtately. In the in≈øide, about the Walls, are to be ≈øeen ≈øeveral ≈øtandings, or holes, as high as a Man, in which it is probable they plac'd their Idols.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:106091:77"/>
                  <p>I ≈øaw next the Church of <hi>Mary Girges,</hi> or of S.
<hi>George,</hi> which is in the ≈øame Street called <hi>Darb itt√°ka,</hi> or <hi>the Street of the Window.</hi> It is very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and of a mean beauty. At the entrance, on the right hand, is to be ≈øeen the Body of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Bi≈ø≈ø√∫ra,</hi> Bi≈øhop and Martyr, with his Epitaph in <hi>Arabick,</hi> which I could not place here, becau≈øe the Printer had not the Characters.</p>
                  <p>Next to this Church I went to ≈øee the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteries of the Nuns, among≈øt the <hi>Copties,</hi> called <hi>D√©r il ben√°t,</hi> or <hi>the Mona≈øtery of the Maids,</hi> which was built, as they ≈øay, by a King called <hi>Alexander;</hi> but it is a place ≈øo filthy and ≈øtinking, that I could not ≈øtay there any time.</p>
                  <p>The la≈øt Church that I ≈øaw in this Ca≈øtle, was that of the Mona≈øtery of S. <hi>George,</hi> of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Greeks.</hi> In this Church is to be ≈øeen an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of this Saint, that, as they ≈øay, hath the Power to heal and cure Fools.

                  <p>It hath been ruinated by the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and turn'd into a Store-hou≈øe of Sugar-Canes. It continued ≈øo to the days of the Patriarch <hi>Ephrem,</hi>

                     <hi>V√°deh ibn R√©gia,</hi> a Noble Man among≈øt the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who turned Chri≈øtian; a little while after being very thir≈øty at <hi>Mecha,</hi> he pray'd to this Saint that he might be carryed into this Church, becau≈øe at that time the River <hi>Nilus</hi> running clo≈øe by, he might there quench his violent thir≈øt. This Saint carried him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into this Church in one Night, a way that the
<hi>Caravan</hi> cannot perform in le≈øs than eight and thirty, or forty days.</p>
                  <p>At the entrance into this Church, on the left hand, is the Cave where dwelt heretofore <hi>Amba Ber≈øum il Eri√°n,</hi> or <hi>Saint Ber≈øum the naked;</hi> which was before the abode of a Serpent that did much hurt to the Inhabitants round about. In the Walls are to be ≈øeen the holes where he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, but as ≈øoon as the Saint was enter'd in to do Penance, the Serpent ca≈øt it ≈øelf at his feet, to do him homage, and afterwards it never hurt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body.

                  <p>A little above this ≈øame Church there is four or five ≈ømall Churches which I had liberty to ≈øee the night of the Fe≈øtival of the
<hi>Epiphany</hi> of the <hi>Copties,</hi> in the Year 1673. I ≈øtaid there to ≈øee the Ceremony they ob≈øerve, in dipping them≈øelves in the Water, in remembrance of Chri≈øt's Bapti≈øm. The Reader may, in the ≈øequel of this Journal, ≈øee this de≈øcribed in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> 1673.</p>
                  <p>Near this Church, is that of <hi>Amba Scin√∫de,</hi> or of Saint <hi>Sennodius;</hi> but the <hi>Turks</hi> have ≈øhut it, to draw from the <hi>Copties</hi> a ≈øum of Money, therefore I could not ≈øee it.</p>
                  <p>When I was out of the Patriarch's Quarters, I went ≈øtraight to

                  <p>We ≈øpent nine hours in going through this De≈øart, going all night through a Campane very equal, full of Sand, and houndle≈øs, and in the morning before the Sun-ri≈øing we arriv'd at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieh,</hi> a very great and con≈øiderable Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Ca≈øcieflik</hi> of
<hi>Fi√∫m,</hi> ≈øcituate at the end of the Wilderne≈øs, about five hours journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Fi√∫m</hi> for a Hor≈øeman.</p>
                  <p>When we had re≈øted here a while, and drunk ≈øome Coffee, according to the cu≈øtom of the Country, we march'd on in our way, and enter'd into <hi>Fi√∫m</hi> about Noon.</p>
                  <p>At my fir≈øt arrival, I lodg'd in a publick Inn called
<hi>Ocalet Beida,</hi> ≈øcituate near the Market, and almo≈øt ruinated, till I could meet with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more convenient abode. About ten days after I chang'd my dwelling, becau≈øe I was too much in the eye of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and caus'd them to be too jealous of me, which a <hi>Franc</hi> ought to be careful of, that he may not be cen≈øur'd and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted by them. I took a lodging near the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians <pb n="151" facs="tcp:106091:79"/>dwellings, at a
<hi>Turks</hi> hou≈øe, called <hi>Tatar Sciaban,</hi> who was a very hone≈øt man, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding his Religion.</p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as the <hi>Turks</hi> ≈øee a <hi>Franc</hi> in a Village or Country, chiefly where they never ≈øaw him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they imagine immediately that he is loaden with Diamonds and Pearls. They take therefore notice of all his ≈øteps, to find out ≈øome occa≈øion to quarrel with him; and of all places of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie,</hi> this happens mo≈øt frequently in
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as I was in the Town, the report ≈øpread about, that a rich <hi>Franc</hi> with a great Train was come. The <hi>Cadi</hi> thinking therefore that he had a per≈øon from whom he might draw a ≈øum of Money, becau≈øe he believ'd that I was a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant come thither to buy Wines in the Vintage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to carry them to <hi>Cairo,</hi> which Commodity is forbidden in all the Territories of the Grand Seignior, he de≈øired the <hi>Naib Gaibe,</hi> or <hi>Soubachi</hi> of the place, to endeavour to find out my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns, and to let him under≈øtand them; for he promi≈øed to give him half the money that he ≈øhould get out of me, if I did buy any Wines.</p>
                  <p>For this purpo≈øe the <hi>Naib Gaibe,</hi> or
<hi>Soubachi,</hi> a Renegade <hi>Fleming,</hi> who ≈øpoke well his Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue, came to my lodging with two Ruffians, and enter'd into my Chamber whiles I was taking out my Cloaths, and without ≈øaluting any body, ≈øate down in a Corner, which is the place that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Ma≈øter of the hou≈øe in the Ea≈øt-Countries: The Ruffians ≈øtood at the door, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their Staves. I was mightily ≈øurpriz'd to ≈øee ≈øuch a per≈øon come to vi≈øit me. I called to my <hi>Janizary</hi> to know what he would have; he an≈øwered, that he under≈øtood that I was a <pb n="152" facs="tcp:106091:80"/>
                     <hi>Franc,</hi> and that he was come to know whether I would buy any Wine, becau≈øe he would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to that which was very good. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, that if he had no other bu≈øine≈øs, he might ≈øpare him≈øelf the trouble and pains that he took, that I was never a Merchant of Wines, and would not now begin; and that we <hi>Francs</hi> care not much for the poor Wines of his Country. To this he held his peace.</p>
                  <p>He enquir'd what Countryman I was; when I had told him that I was of the City of <hi>Erford</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> he ≈øeem'd to rejoyce, becau≈øe he had found one in ≈øuch a far Country whom he might name his Countryman, for he ≈øaid he was of <hi>Am≈øterdam.</hi> He promis'd me his friend≈øhip; we eat afterwards together, and I caus'd him to drink Wine as much as he would, which was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing to him: when the liquor had a little chear'd his ≈øpirits, he di≈øcover'd to me the de≈øign of the
<hi>Cadi,</hi> and the cau≈øe of his Vi≈øit; by this means he became one of my be≈øt Friends in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and my ≈øafety whiles I continued in that Town, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom I ≈øhould not have e≈øcap'd the Train that was laid for me.</p>
                  <p>After a little re≈øt in my lodging, I ≈øought ≈øome means to ≈øtrike acquaintance with the Bi≈øhop of the place, called <hi>Amba Michel,</hi> who had a very good repute of an hone≈øt and a learned man, becau≈øe I was de≈øirous to have ≈øome body to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe with, and to ≈øpend my time with ≈øome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to my ≈øelf; I obtain'd this with ea≈øe, for he came a few days after and lodg'd at my hou≈øe: I am much beholding to him for many things that he hath told me concerning their Belief and Ceremonies, which I have in≈øerted in my <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:106091:80"/>
                  <p>Let us now ≈øee the de≈øcription of the Town and Territory of
<hi>Fium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Town of <hi>Fium,</hi> the chief of the Province whereof it bears the name, is large and full of people: It is built upon the Ruines of the old <hi>Ar≈øinoe,</hi> which is near adjoyning on the We≈øt-≈øide. Though the mo≈øt part of the hou≈øes are but little, and made of Bricks dried in the Sun, they are neverthele≈øs commodious, and ≈øome, where the Officers and Commanders dwell, are large and beautiful. There be many <hi>Copties</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, and a Bi≈øhop, but no Church within the Walls; they perform their Devotions at <hi>De≈øie,</hi> a Village near by.</p>
                  <p>An artificial Channel cut from the River pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth through this City, from Ea≈øt to We≈øt: They name it <hi>Bahr Ju≈øef,</hi> or the
<hi>River of Jo≈øeph,</hi> for they believe that <hi>Jo≈øeph, Jacobs</hi> Son, caus'd it to be made. 'Tis call'd al≈øo <hi>Calitz il Menhi,</hi> or the
<hi>Channel of Menhi.</hi> This Channel is remarkable, becau≈øe it keeps fre≈øh water all the year, which proceeds from ≈øeveral Fountains there, but it is too ≈øhallow to carry Boats but when the River overflows. It begins about three days journey from <hi>Fium,</hi> drawing towards the South, near a Village named <hi>Tarut I≈ø≈øcerif,</hi> where I have been. It runs, when it hath left the Town, into the Lake named <hi>Birket il Kern,</hi> or the Lake of
<hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> where the waters become ≈øalt.</p>
                  <p>In this Town are to be ≈øeen many Relicks of Antiquity, as Capitals, Antick Works, Pillars of Marble broken. In the Corn-market is to be ≈øeen a great Pillar, entire laid upon the ground, and a great Mill-≈øtone, both of a red ≈øtone; and almo≈øt in all hou≈øes is to be ≈øeen ≈øomething very remarkable for its antiquity.</p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:106091:81"/>
                  <p>Here is made much Linen for the hou≈øe, and Canvas to pack up the Commodities of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: They have a great deal of Flax, which yields a great benefit; ≈øtrak'd Linen is plentiful here, and very good, with which the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people cloath them≈øelves. The Leather of this Country is much e≈øteem'd, but chiefly the Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets that are made here are the fine≈øt of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and are carried all over the world. Here are al≈øo made Sacks of Network of Cord, to carry upon Camels Straw, or dried Dung to burn, or Stones, or ≈øome ≈øuch thing, for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver u≈øe Carts.</p>
                  <p>This Territory is very fruitful and plea≈øant, and all that grows here is of a better ta≈øte than in the other Provinces. Here are Fields full of Ro≈øe-trees, and Woods of Fig-trees, which are not in other parts of
<hi>Egypt.</hi> The Gardens are full of all manner of Trees, bearing Fruit; as Pear-trees, Orange-trees, Lemon-tree, Peach-trees, Plumb-trees, Apricock-trees, and many others that are ≈øent to be ≈øold at <hi>Cairo,</hi> which yields them a great profit.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Fium</hi> only, of all the Provinces of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are Vineyards; and in the≈øe Villages only, in <hi>Fidimin</hi> where I have been, in <hi>Nacalife, Seliin, Abuke≈øa, Agiamiin, Gerrado,</hi> and
<hi>Tobhar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They make Wine thus: They pre≈øs the Grapes either with their Feet, or other wi≈øe, into a great Earthen Ve≈ø≈øel; they put afterwards the new Wine into a Sack of cour≈øe Linen, and ≈øtrain it into another Ve≈ø≈øel; from thence they draw it, and ≈øecure it in Jars well pitch'd within, which contain about twelve thou≈øand Drams. Now the≈øe Jars they place in the Sun during ≈øeven days, <pb n="155" facs="tcp:106091:81"/>leaving them open, that the new Wine might purge it ≈øelf; they ≈øtop them afterwards with Palm-leaves, and cover them clo≈øe with Mud. They leave their Wine in this manner, till they intend to drink it.</p>
                  <p>This Wine is not much e≈øteemed of by the <hi>Francs,</hi> becau≈øe there remains ≈øo much dregs that come out into the Cup with the Wine; but if they had but the art of clearing and clarifying the Wine, it would be doubtle≈øs a very plea≈øant Wine, for the Grapes are very ≈øweet, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing to the ta≈øte.</p>
                  <p>I have not ≈øeen a Province in <hi>Egypt</hi> that is ≈øo much cut into Channels as this: They all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>Jo≈øephs</hi> River, and they are made to water the Fields with more ea≈øe; and becau≈øe this great number of Ditches would hinder men from travelling up and down, were it not for the Bridges, here be more than in any other part of <hi>Egypt.</hi> They are all made with burnt Bricks, and very ≈øtrong: The Tradition ≈øaith, that they were builded in the days of the <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s; and it is the opinion of the <hi>Copties,</hi> that the≈øe Kings imployed the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> in making Bricks for the≈øe Bridges, which is very probable; for it is certain, that almo≈øt an infinite number of men are needful to make ≈øuch a prodigious quantity of Bricks.</p>
                  <p>This Province of <hi>Fium</hi> anciently had three hundred three≈øcore and five Towns and Villages, but now there be but three≈øcore and two; all the other have been ≈øwallowed up in the Lake <hi>Kern,</hi> or de≈øtroyed by the tyranny of the Governours.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> dwells in the Town: He pays now to the
<hi>Pacha</hi> five and twenty Pur≈øes, and five <pb n="156" facs="tcp:106091:82"/>to his
<hi>Kehaja,</hi> or Lieutenant, and to his <hi>Agas.</hi> He pays for his Province two hundred pur≈øes in four payments. The <hi>Divan</hi> of
<hi>Cairo</hi> allows him three Cornets of Hor≈øe, or <hi>Spahins,</hi> to keep his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, unto whom he pays every ≈øix Months five and twenty
<hi>Pia≈øters,</hi> which is but a ≈ømall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; ≈øo that they are but poorly clad, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as ≈øo many Beggars, rather than as the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of ≈øo great an Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Town of <hi>Ar≈øinoe,</hi> ≈øcituated near
<hi>Fium,</hi> on the North-Ea≈øt-≈øide, is now totally rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated: There remains nothing of it now, but a great many Mountains very high rai≈øed, with the ruines and rubbi≈øh of the Town. They ≈øhew ≈øufficiently, that it was one of the greate≈øt and mo≈øt glorious Cities of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The people of the Country call it, <hi>Medinet Fares,</hi> or <hi>the Town of the Per≈øian;</hi> but I could never under≈øtand the cau≈øe of this name.</p>
                  <p>They ≈øay that it was de≈øtroyed and burnt by Cats, which the Enemies ≈øet into it when they had tyed Fire-brands at their Tails, which ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the fire into every corner of the City, and burnt it to a≈øhes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> call it in their Books <hi>Ar≈øinoe,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> calls all that Province, the <hi>Government of Ar≈øinoe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 24th of this Month I went to <hi>Fidintin,</hi> a Village di≈øtant from <hi>Fium</hi> about two hours ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, towards the We≈øt, to vi≈øit the Bi≈øhop, who was gone thither out of the <hi>Ca≈øciefs</hi> ≈øight. I was cloathed in a Turki≈øh habit, with a <hi>Janizary</hi> and a
<hi>Negre</hi> well armed, upon good Hor≈øes. Our coming put the poor Bi≈øhop into ≈øuch a fright, that he thought him≈øelf already kill'd, when he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106091:82"/>heard that three ≈øtrange Hor≈øe-men ask'd for him. He thought at fir≈øt that we were ≈øome ≈øent by the <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> to do him an injury. The≈øe poor people are become wonderful timerous, through the continual tyranny of tho≈øe Barbarians, ≈øo that at the lea≈øt motion they tremble and ≈øhake. He was pretty well ≈øatisfied, when I told him that I was a <hi>Franc</hi> come purpo≈øely to crave acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him: He entertain'd us in a very poor dwelling, invited us into his Parlour, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with very good Wine of the Country. When we had ≈øpent ≈øome hours in conver≈øation with him, we went to ≈øee the Vines of that Quarter, and in the Evening we return'd home to the City.</p>
                  <p>The 29th of the ≈øame Month I went to <hi>Bija<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muh,</hi> a Village about half a League from <hi>Fium,</hi> towards the North, to ≈øee an ancient thing, the Body of a great Statue of a Gyant, of a red Stone, without Head or Arms, ≈øtanding upon a Ba≈øis. This Statue is behind the Village, in a great broad Road.</p>
                  <p>I could never learn what it is, becau≈øe the Country-people have no Tradition of it; and in the Hi≈øtories of <hi>Egypt</hi> there is no mention made of it. I have only learnt that the people of the Country call it the <hi>Statue of Pharaoh;</hi> which I think not to be true, becau≈øe it is the cu≈øtom of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to entitle all things of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary bigne≈øs with the name of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> from a conceit they have that they were all Gyants.</p>
                  <p>The Ba≈øis of this Statue is ≈øquare, of hewn ≈øtones that are very great, every ≈øtone hath two foot and a half in breadth, and almo≈øt ten foot in length; the fore-front hath five Perches in length, that is about thirty foot.</p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:106091:83"/>
                  <p>Near this Ba≈øis five others ≈øtand in a Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle, but le≈øs, and without any Statue upon them.</p>
                  <p>The Bi≈øhop inform'd me, that heretofore in this Village was an
<hi>Agia≈øma,</hi> or <hi>Fountain of holy Water,</hi> called by the Arab.
<hi>Ein il Mandura;</hi> and that every <hi>Holy-Thur≈øday</hi> a great many Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were wont to meet there to drink of this Water out of devotion, but that the people of the place, who are all <hi>Mahometans,</hi> have ≈øtop'd it up, to prevent the continuance of this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtition.</p>
                  <p>When we had well ≈øeen the≈øe things, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Town, and in our way we went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Ruines of the ancient
<hi>Ar≈øinoe,</hi> where I ≈øaw nothing remarkable, but ≈øome old Walls which my Guide told me were the remains of a Bath.</p>
                  <p>When we were come near the Town, we left it on the left hand, and went to ≈øee the <hi>Needle of Bibig,</hi> whereof this is the de≈øcription.</p>
                  <p>This Needle is placed on the ground, without any Ba≈øis, in the middle of a Corn-field, in a place where is no hou≈øe, nor mark of any that hath been there.</p>
                  <p>It is di≈øtant from <hi>Fium</hi> about a long half league, near a Village called <hi>Bibig,</hi> from whence it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows the name. This Village is ≈øcituated on the South-we≈øt of <hi>Fium,</hi> and belongs unto it.</p>
                  <p>It is built in a long ≈øquare, very high; its lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt ≈øides have ≈øix foot, and the narrowe≈øt are of four. This Needle abuts not into a ≈øharp point, as others in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but the top is made like an A≈ø≈øes back: On the South-≈øide, which is one of the large≈øt, there are three ranks of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <pb n="159" facs="tcp:106091:83"/>that repre≈øent Men and Women holding one another by the hand: under the≈øe three ranks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin fourteen ranks of Hieroglyphick Characters, about the bigne≈øs of a finger, which are to be read from the top to the bottom; every rank is divided from the other, which is near, with a line that is drawn between, all along the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: So that without doubt this Needle is the mo≈øt curious that may be ≈øeen. In every one of the le≈ø≈øer ≈øides is but one rank of le≈ø≈øer Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, which yet continue very clear and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing to be lamented at, that time hath almo≈øt blotted out the Figures, from the middle of the Pillar to the bottom; and that the Stones have not been able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves from corruption, being much worn out: It is of a red Stone, as all others.</p>
                  <p>Its top is like an A≈ø≈øes back, and very large, ≈øit for the Vultures and Hawks to pitch upon it at night: The≈øe Birds have ≈øo whitened it with their dung, that the uppermo≈øt Figures are ≈øcarce to be di≈øcern'd.</p>
                  <p>I have taken notice, that all the Needles that I have ≈øeen in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> ≈øtand not upon any Ba≈øis, but upon the ground, which makes me believe that the invention of planting them upon a Ba≈øis, is not derived from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but from the <hi>Romans,</hi> who having taken notice that this kind of Pillar was very u≈øeful, and contain'd great My≈øteries in their Characters, they have rais'd them upon a Ba≈øis, to render them more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and con≈øiderable to the curious. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Town about Noon.</p>

<hi>Fium,</hi> ≈øcituate on the North of this Town, and about four hours travelling on Hor≈øeback, to ≈øee the remains of Antiquity that are there, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; be≈øides my Servants, ≈øome other <hi>Copties</hi> Chri≈øtians went with me.</p>
                  <p>When I had a little re≈øted my ≈øelf at <hi>Sennuris,</hi> in the hou≈øe of <hi>Sciech il Beled,</hi> the Chief of the Village, a
<hi>Moor,</hi> where my friends oblig'd me to take my lodging, I went to take notice of the Village, which is great, and very beautiful; and at the ≈øame time I ≈øaw the Church of the <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> dedicated to the Archangel
<hi>S. Michael,</hi> but it is very mean.</p>
                  <p>Neverthele≈øs, I took notice there of one thing very remarkable, namely, a ≈øquare ≈øtone, where are three little Figures cut the fir≈øt repre≈øents the Archangel <hi>S. Michael,</hi> the middle repre≈øents the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who holds in her Arms her Son, and the third the Angel <hi>Raphael.</hi> The names of every one is written underneath in Greek Letters, in the <hi>Copties</hi> Language. This ≈øtone is a foot and a half long from ≈øide to ≈øide: The Prie≈øts informed me, that this Stone was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Chancel, but when they ≈øaw that the people render'd homage to the≈øe Figures, they plac'd them in a corner of the Church, that they might hinder them from Idolatry. They offer'd it to me for a <hi>Pia≈øter</hi> and a half, becau≈øe I ≈øeem'd to value it at a high rate; I would not take it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe I had no intent to return ≈øo ≈øoon to <hi>Cairo,</hi> but to go further into <hi>Sayda.</hi>

                  <p>At the <hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide of the Village, about a Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-≈øhot from it, is to be ≈øeen a very ancient Bridge of Bricks, made for a Pa≈ø≈øage for the River when it overflows. The People of the Country ≈øay, that <hi>Jo≈øeph, Jacob</hi>'s Son, cau≈øed it to be built. It is apparent by its Ruines, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore it was very great, but now there remains no more but four Arches.</p>
                  <p>Round about this Village is ≈øown a great deal of Flax, but it is not e≈øteem'd ≈øo good as that which grows in other parts of

                  <p>At that time there was, as well as at, <hi>Fi√∫m,</hi> a want of fre≈øh Water, becau≈øe the people of the Country u≈øually ca≈øt into the River their Hemp, where they take their Water to drink; this had ≈øo poi≈øoned the Waters, that they did ≈øtink, ≈øo that I was forced to cau≈øe ≈øome fre≈øh Water to be brought from <hi>Fi√∫m,</hi> which is about four hours di≈øtant from this Village.</p>
                  <p>In an evening I walk'd to ≈øee the Lake <hi>Kern,</hi> which is very near <hi>Senn√∫ris,</hi> on the <hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide.</p>
                  <p>This Lake is narrow, but long, for I was told that it is about two days travelling for a Hor≈øe, in length. This is doubtle≈øs the Lake
<hi>Miris</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Pliny,</hi> when he ≈øaith, <hi>Inter Ar≈øino√Øten Prafecturam, ac Memphiten Lacus fuit, circuitu CCL.M. pa≈ø≈øuum, aut ut Mutianus tradit, CCCCL.M. &amp; latitudinis L. pa≈ø≈øuum, manu factus √† Rege qui fecerat Moeridis appellatus:</hi> For there is no other Lake between <hi>Fium,</hi> which is <hi>Ar≈øinoe,</hi> and the City of
<hi>Memphis,</hi> or the place where it ≈øtood.</p>
                  <p>At its <hi>Ea≈øtern</hi> end is plac'd the Village
<hi>Tam√≠ch,</hi> mentioned before; and in its <hi>We≈øt</hi> end is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ca≈øtle of <hi>Vizir Caron,</hi> of which I ≈øhall ≈øpeak hereafter.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:106091:85"/>
                  <p>This Lake receives all the Waters that run from the Fields when
<hi>Nilus</hi> is overflown, and from the River of <hi>Jo≈øeph<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                     </hi> they become ≈øalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Earth is full of Niter.</p>
                  <p>Here is much Fi≈øh, chiefly a Fi≈øh called is <hi>Arab. Houd,</hi> which I have de≈øcribed in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning the Fi≈øh of
<hi>Nilus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ≈øide of the Lake are De≈øarts of Sand very large; I have heard from Per≈øons worthy to be believed, that there are to be ≈øeen many remarkable Ruines of ancient Towns, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of <hi>Temeh i≈ø≈øebag,</hi> or of <hi>Temeh</hi> of <hi>Lieus;</hi> a Town ≈øo named becau≈øe of the Statues of <hi>Lieus</hi> that were there to be ≈øeen.</p>
                  <p>Here is al≈øo to be ≈øeen the Ruines of an ancient Mona≈øtery named <hi>Deir Abul√≠fe,</hi> or the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery of
<hi>Abul√≠fe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They told me, that they had ≈øeen the Labyrinth which is at the end of the Lake <hi>We≈øterly,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pliny,</hi> when he ≈øaith, <hi>There was a Labyrinth in the Lake of Moeridis, built without any Wood.</hi> This Labyrinth is named now by the <hi>Egyptians, Ca≈ø≈ør Carun,</hi> or the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Vizir Caron;</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lord in the Hi≈øtories of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of his Trea≈øures which are ≈øaid to be here buried, and kept by dreadful <hi>Tali≈ømans.</hi> They tell me, that this Ca≈øtle hath three hundred and three≈øcore and five Chambers, ≈øo intangled one into another that a man cannot get out, if when he comes in he doth not take notice of the way.</p>
                  <p>This Report gave me a great de≈øire to venture to ≈øee all the≈øe Wonders at any rate: I had already agreed with the Chieftain of the Village, to have from him a Guard of twelve Men, whom he knew
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106091:85"/>to be faithful and tru≈øty; but my Jani≈ø≈øary, a timerous Fellow, ≈øpoil'd my de≈øign, by ≈øhewing me the danger there was of the <hi>Arabians;</hi> he threatned likewi≈øe the Guard, to tell the
<hi>Ca≈øcief,</hi> which would have created me ≈øome trouble.</p>
                  <p>I conceive that this Relation may beget a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire in ≈øome Traveller to go and ≈øee this Curio≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore I will give him a little advice which ≈øhall help him to accompli≈øh his de≈øign.</p>
                  <p>He mu≈øt know, that he ought not to go to the Labyrinth from
<hi>Sennuris,</hi> or to the other ≈øide of the Lake, but to <hi>Senhur,</hi> a Village di≈øtant from <hi>Sennuris</hi> about an hours travelling; for there the Fi≈øher-men of the Lake <hi>Caron</hi> dwell, who are be≈øt able to carry Men thither: But it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needful that a <hi>Franc,</hi> who will undertake this Voyage, be well learn'd in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue, that he be well cloathed according to the Mode of the Country, that he may not be known, and chiefly let him di≈ø≈øemble his de≈øign as much as he can; for if he fails in any of the≈øe particulars, he will doubtle≈øs be lo≈øt. The
<hi>Moors,</hi> who are very jealous of the Trea≈øures that are ≈øaid to be there, will knock him on the head, that he may not carry them away.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øtaid three days at <hi>Sennuris,</hi> for the place did plea≈øe me, and the Inhabitants were very civil. I return'd to <hi>Fium,</hi> ≈øecond day of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> very much di≈øpleas'd with my Jani≈ø≈øary, becau≈øe he had cro≈øs'd my de≈øign.</p>
                  <p>On the ≈øecond day of this Month the Water of <hi>Nilus</hi> enters into the Channel of <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> which pa≈ø≈øeth through
<hi>Fium,</hi> as we have ≈øaid. Then its Waters are purified, and purged from its ≈øtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualities which the Flax and Hemp give it: <pb n="164" facs="tcp:106091:86"/>Then the Ci≈øterns of the Town are fill'd with Water, which the Inhabitants drink all the year long, therefore this inundation makes all the people of the Country round about to rejoice.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thur≈øday,</hi> the 4th of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> I went to that of <hi>Havara,</hi> ≈øo called from the neighbouring Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
<hi>Havara.</hi> It Stands about an hour and a halfs walking from
<hi>Fium,</hi> on the South ≈øide, ≈øcituated in a ≈øandy Wilderne≈øs, like that which is over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt <hi>Cairo,</hi> where the <hi>Pyramides</hi> ≈øtand: when we were gone beyond a certain Bridge of Brick, very old, which is upon the Highway of <hi>Bene≈øuef,</hi> we left it, to take a ≈øhorter cour≈øe; but we found cau≈øe to repent it, becau≈øe the way was craggy and full of Sand.</p>
                  <p>We were oblig'd al≈øo to go through the <hi>Bahr Belame,</hi> or the River without Water, which cau≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to endure much trouble and fear, in regard of the depth that was extraordinary, and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to climb up again. And when we had overcome all the≈øe difficulties, and were near the
<hi>Pyramide,</hi> about ≈øix hundred Paces from it we met with a Ditch of the River of <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> full of Water; we could not get over it, but were forced to ≈øtay <pb n="165" facs="tcp:106091:86"/>on that ≈øide, and from thence take a vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Pyramide,</hi> to my great di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure. I took notice, that in its elevation and breadth, it was much like the ≈øecond <hi>Pyramide</hi> which is at <hi>Gize,</hi> but the length of time hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt reduc'd it to Du≈øt, ≈øo that it appears like a ≈øharp Mountain of Sand, rather than a
<hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The De≈øart where it ≈øtands, is like that of the
<hi>Mommies</hi> which is near <hi>Sacc√†ra.</hi> Some Wells of
<hi>Mommies</hi> are here to be found, whereof the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is fill'd up with Sand, and ≈øome are half empty.

                  </p>
                  <p>But becau≈øe we were without any Guide, and my Jani≈ø≈øary was a very Coward, having none but him with me, he allarm'd me ≈øeveral times with the fear of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> be≈øides, our Bea≈øts were tired with the deep way; I was therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrain'd to ≈øet bounds to my Curio≈øity, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Town, pa≈ø≈øing through the River with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Water, near its Mouth, leaving on our left hand, near the <hi>Pyramide</hi> of
<hi>Havara,</hi> the Ruines of an ancient Town, whereof I could never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand the name; and a little further, on the ≈øame ≈øide, the Village of <hi>Havara,</hi> from whence this <hi>Pyramide</hi> borrows the name, and at a little di≈øtance from this Village, a very ancient Bridge, and very high, which is made to give a pa≈ø≈øage to the River <hi>Nilus</hi> when it overflows: We return'd to <hi>Fium</hi> again about Noon.</p>

                  <head>A Walk to the Mona≈øtery <hi>Ca≈øciabe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ON the 19th of <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> I went to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery of
<hi>Ca≈øciabe,</hi> di≈øtant from <hi>Fium</hi> about two hours walking, or thereabouts, drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>South-Ea≈øt</hi> in the Wilderne≈øs, called by the <hi>Arabians, Gebel Naklon,</hi> or <hi>the Mountain of Naklon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In our way to this Mona≈øtery we went over ≈øeveral Bridges of Brick, very ≈øtrong, made by the ancient <hi>Egyptians:</hi> And we left at our right hand at the entry of the Wilderne≈øs, which is about half way, the Mona≈øtery of <hi>Deir il azeb;</hi> and a little further, at our left hand, the Ruines of an ancient Town overthrown, of which I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learn the name.</p>
                  <p>The Mona≈øtery of <hi>Ca≈øciabe</hi> is very ancient; it is almo≈øt totally ruinated, unle≈øs it be the Church dedicated to the Arch-Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> which is very beautiful, and painted in the in≈øide with the Pa≈ø≈øages of holy Writ. The top of this Church is ≈øupported by Pillars that ≈øtand at a di≈øtance, and of divers Stones. Under this Church is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that I could not ≈øee, becau≈øe the Provi≈øions of the Mona≈øtery were there ≈øhut up.</p>
                  <p>This Church was built by one named <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>r,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Ibra≈øcit,</hi> a very famous Magician; who, <pb n="167" facs="tcp:106091:87"/>as the
<hi>Arabian</hi> Hi≈øtories relate, had this Child by a Daughter of an Ea≈øtern King. When at la≈øt this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>r</hi> had left the Art of Magick which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had taught him, he addicted him≈øelf to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ≈øo that afterwards he became Bi≈øhop of <hi>Fium,</hi> and built this Church, and Tradition ≈øaith, that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> laid the Foundation-≈øtone of the Church, and of the Altar, and the Archangel S. <hi>Michael</hi> mark'd out the Quire, and the re≈øt of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Many remarkable things happened whiles this Church was building; I mention them not for brevity ≈øake, they that will under≈øtand them, may read the <hi>Arabian</hi> Manu≈øcript mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now in the Kings Library.</p>
                  <p>On the top of the Mountain, behind this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na≈øtery, on the South-≈øide, are yet to be ≈øeen the ruines of an ancient Town, which the

<hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A little higher, upon the ≈øame ≈øandy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, are to be ≈øeen many Caves where the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits anciently lived; I went into ≈øome of them out of curio≈øity, they are very little, and there is in them nothing extraordinary: when I had taken a view of all that was remarkable, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Fium</hi> in the Evening.</p>
                  <p>The Country had been ≈øome days dround about <hi>Fium,</hi> which oblig'd the Commanders of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and the
<hi>Ca≈øcief,</hi> to retreat to <hi>Cairo.</hi> And becau≈øe the Robbers are very formidable at this time, and commit many di≈øorders, I was oblig'd to return al≈øo to <hi>Cairo.</hi> I went from <hi>Fium</hi> the 16th of
<hi>Augu≈øt</hi> in the morning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned <pb n="168" facs="tcp:106091:88"/>the ≈øame way that I came, and the next day I was at <hi>Cairo</hi> in the Evening, after five and twenty days abode at <hi>Fium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At my return to <hi>Cairo,</hi> I began my <hi>Church of Alexandria;</hi> a very curious work, and very u≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the world, and chiefly to the Learned that de≈øire to under≈øtand how the Churches of the
<hi>Ea≈øt</hi> agree with the <hi>Roman.</hi> It contains all the Ceremonies and Doctrines of the Ancient and Venerable Church of the <hi>Copties,</hi> which is that of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> I have taken them out of two Manu≈øcripts in <hi>Arab.</hi> very ancient and rare, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us in
<hi>Europe</hi> before now; the one is called <hi>il Mosbah iddolme d' Abulbaracat,</hi> and the other, <hi>il Giauharet innefi≈ø≈øe fielm il Keni≈øe.</hi> I have been very exact and diligent in compo≈øing this Book, that it might render my name immortal. I ≈øhall endeavour to give it to the Pre≈øs as ≈øoon as I ≈øhall be return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I make my ordinary abode.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øecond of <hi>September,</hi> which was the third
<hi>Friday</hi> after the opening of the <hi>Calitz,</hi> a skilful Swimmer cau≈øed him≈øelf to be admired of all the City, by a very bold action; he had his arms tyed behind his back, his feet tyed at an Iron Chain, which weighed ten pounds: In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ventur'd to ≈øwim upon his back, from the mouth of the <hi>Calitz.</hi> to the end of the Town, which is about three quarters of an hour walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a-foot.</p>
                  <p>This cu≈øtom hath been anciently us'd in <hi>Cairo:</hi> A skilful Swimmer performs this every year, two <hi>Fridays</hi> following after that the <hi>Calitz</hi> is open'd. The <hi>Pacha</hi> gives him for his reward a thou≈øand <hi>Meidins,</hi> which make three and thirty
<hi>Pia≈øters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:106091:88"/>
                  <p>The Guards of the <hi>Soubachi</hi> went before him in a Boat, to hinder him from receiving any harm: about five and twenty other Boats full of Spectators followed. He ≈øwum this year but once, becau≈øe <hi>Ibrahim Pacha,</hi> who loved not ≈øuch u≈øele≈øs expences, commanded him away when he came to demand his ordinary wages; therefore in≈øtead of a thou≈øand
<hi>Meidins,</hi> he gave him but one hundred.</p>
                  <p>There is another that ≈øwims in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as this, from the beginning of the <hi>Calitz</hi> to the end of the City. He had his feet tyed with a Chain, a Di≈øh of Coffee in one hand, and a Pipe of Tobacco lighted in the other, at his mouth. The <hi>Pacha</hi> u≈øually gives him the ≈øame reward; but becau≈øe the former had not had his u≈øual Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this la≈øt would not this year ≈øhew his dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I was told that the≈øe Swimmers eat nothing for three days but Cich-Pea≈øen, and that they ≈øwallow their breath ≈øo long time, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth their Bellies to ≈øwell, and become light as an empty Bladder.

                  <p>On the 12th of <hi>September</hi> the <hi>Pacha</hi> cau≈øed the Trea≈øure of the Grand Seignior to depart for <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> with its ordinary guard and pomp.</p>
                  <p>There were one and thirty Mules loaden with <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Coyn, and <hi>Zequins</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> This Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure amounts u≈øually to one thou≈øand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pur≈øes, and each Pur≈øe to five hundred Crowns. The <hi>Sangiac-Bey</hi> that carries it is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to expend all the Moneys needful for this Voyage, and it co≈øts him u≈øually one hundred Pur≈øes, or fifty thou≈øand Crowns.

                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:106091:89"/>begins to march in the beginning of the Moon and arrives at <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> at the end of one hundred days.</p>

                  <p>According to the example of tho≈øe great men, a little before his death he buried his own Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, and put a Crocodile made by the Tali≈øma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Art to keep them.</p>
                  <p>In this Mountain, and near this Mo≈øque, he cau≈øed ≈øeveral Caves to be digg'd wide and large in the Rock, ≈øo as to pa≈øs from one into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in the furthermo≈øt he cau≈øe a Pond to be made to keep water in, cut in the Rock; in it is a Crocodile that begins to fly at one as ≈øoon as a man enters in. Moreover, in the bottom of the water, is to be ≈øeen a door which leads to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caves under ground, where the Records of <hi>Egypt</hi> declare that his Trea≈øures are hid. No man can imagine from whence this water can come, for the Cave is upon a high Mountain which is very dry always, and in this place is no Spring: And it is not known what this Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile is, and how he may be nouri≈øhed, during ≈øo many ages. To take this Trea≈øure, you mu≈øt know how to undo this Tali≈øman, that is, one mu≈øt take away the water, and the life of the Crocodile; for both are the effects of Magick, which depend upon the Art of the Tali≈ømans.</p>
                  <p>I have been very diligent in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ≈øeek for, and ≈øend to <hi>Paris,</hi> among≈øt other rare Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcripts, the anciente≈øt and be≈øt Authors of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which might give ≈øome light and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106091:90"/>knowledge of this Noble Science. I may ≈øay that I have emptied <hi>Egypt</hi> of ≈øuch kind of Books, with an intent that if I was ever admitted to the ≈øervice of him who had given me this Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, I might have the time and the means to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover with ea≈øe the admirable ≈øecrets of this Science, and to unfold the Enigms under which it lies hid; and by the ≈øame means to di≈øcover of what con≈øequence tho≈øe Manu≈øcripts are, though they are de≈øpi≈øed by ≈øome that under≈øtand not neither their price nor u≈øe.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may peru≈øe an <hi>Arabian</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcript in
<hi>Quarto,</hi> called, <hi>Eijun it hekajek, ve eidah il terajek,</hi> of
<hi>Meimun</hi> the Magician that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the means to de≈øtroy all manner of Tali≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. He may read another in <hi>Octavo,</hi> called, <hi>Kitab gaiet il maareb, Fi menajeh ve il chabaia, ve il medaleb,</hi> that di≈øcovers the places of all the Trea≈øures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their value, the Figure of the Tali≈øman that keeps them, and how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy them; I have ≈øent them both to the Kings Library.</p>
                  <p>On the 12th and 20th of <hi>September,</hi> I went to ≈øee the Great Aqueduct, called in <hi>Arab. it Migro,</hi> that conveys water from the River into the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi>'s Ca≈øtle.</p>
                  <p>This Aqueduct is near <hi>Nilus</hi> in old <hi>Cairo;</hi> the Mouth there ≈øtands a Ca≈øtle of a Hexagone Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure very high, ≈øupported by as many Arches very lofty. There is an a≈øcent through a large way, open towards Heaven, made ≈øloping about, for the conveniency of the Oxen that draw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the River, and cau≈øe it to mount up by ≈øeven Wheels as high as the Platform on the top of the Ca≈øtle, where there is a large Pond
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106091:90"/>or Ba≈øon to receive the water, and about it ≈øeven great holes like Wells, which have given the name to this Ca≈øtle of the
<hi>Seven Wells.</hi> The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter runs from this Ba≈øon into the Aqueduct, which appears, and from thence it goes into the <hi>Caraffe,</hi> which is at a great di≈øtance, where it meets with the Earth as high as the Aqueduct; and then it ≈øtops there, and runs next into a Channel under ground to the
<hi>Pachas</hi> Stable, from whence it runs into his Ci≈øtern, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhes the Ca≈øtle.</p>
                  <p>This Aqueduct is ≈øupported by three hundred and ≈øeventeen high Arches, and not by three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty, as a certain Traveller ≈øaith, for I have exactly number'd them my ≈øelf: They are made as well as the Ca≈øtle of great ≈øquare ≈øtones, cut as we do Diamonds: One of the Supporters on the chief ≈øide is about eight foot nine inches broad, and under the Arch it is only eight foot. The opening of one of the Arches is fourteen foot and a half broad.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copties</hi> ≈øay that <hi>Mekaukes,</hi> a famous man of their Nation, and Governour for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Heraclius,</hi> made this Aqueduct, but they are mi≈øtaken; for when this man governed in
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Cairo</hi> was not in being, for it was built four hundred and forty four years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and therefore this Aqueduct that now ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it with water was not then needful; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, the In≈øcriptions in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that this is a work of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kings; if I be not mi≈øtaken, I have read that it was Sultan <hi>Gauri,</hi> the la≈øt King but one of the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melukes,</hi> that cau≈øed it to be built.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pacha</hi> taketh out of the Revenues of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106091:91"/>Grand Seignior all that is needful to keep up this Aqueduct; for that purpo≈øe be nouri≈øheth three≈øcore Oxen, and gives wages to five men and a <hi>Ciurbachi</hi> that looke after it.</p>
                  <p>On the 13th of the Month of <hi>September,</hi> I went to vi≈øit the Patriarch of the <hi>Copties,</hi> one of my be≈øt Friends; and becau≈øe I had often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to come and dine with me, I reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the ≈øame intreaty now again; but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered me, that he had not been out of his hou≈øe a year before for fear of the <hi>Turks:</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, that all the Patriarchs of the other Sects had the liberty to go about the Town, without fear of being di≈øturb'd by any, to vi≈øit whom they pleas'd, and to travel whither they li≈øted; but he was ≈øo narrowly ob≈øerved by the
<hi>Turks,</hi> that he could not ≈øo much as go out of his hou≈øe, nor talk with any of other Nations openly, much le≈øs travel into any other place, but he mu≈øt give them a jealou≈øie of plotting again≈øt the State; by this means his life would be in danger.</p>
                  <p>I mu≈øt needs confe≈øs, that there is no Nation in
<hi>Egypt</hi> ≈øo much afflicted as are the <hi>Copties,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they have no body among≈øt them who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerves to be honoured for his Knowledge, or feared for his Power and Authority<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> for all that were rich and wealthy, are de≈øtroyed by the cruelty of the <hi>Mahometans:</hi> therefore the re≈øt are now look'd upon as the Scum of the World, and wor≈øe than the
<hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> abu≈øe them at their plea≈øure; they ≈øhut up their Churches, and the doors of their Hou≈øes when they plea≈øe, upon light occa≈øions, altogether unju≈øt, to draw from them ≈øome ≈øums of Money.</p>
                  <p>There was ≈øuch a tyrannical Action practi≈øed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106091:91"/>upon them in this Month of <hi>September;</hi> for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Jani≈ø≈øaries cut the Throat of a Whore, and ca≈øt her Body into the Lake <hi>Ezbekie.</hi> Upon that the <hi>Soubachi</hi> nailed up the Doors of all the Hou≈øes of the <hi>Copties</hi> round about, and cau≈øed them wrongfully to lay down the Sum of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand <hi>Pia≈øters</hi> for this blood ≈øpilt, before they could have their Hou≈øes opened again, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for their lives.</p>
                  <p>They endured another Cruelty in the ≈øame Year; for <hi>Pacha Ibrahim</hi> increa≈øed their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tax in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Till this Year they were not all obliged to pay the ≈øame Sum of Money. They were not all bound to pay it into the Trea≈øury of the Grand
<hi>Seignior;</hi> for ≈øome were bound to pay it to certain
<hi>Mo≈øques,</hi> othere to <hi>Sciech il Becri,</hi> who is a great Lord, and comes from <hi>Abn Becr, Califf,</hi> or Succe≈ø≈øor of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and others to other Lords, called in <hi>Arab. Sadats.</hi> They that payed to the <hi>Mo≈øques,</hi> or Lords, were called <hi>Lay-Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries:</hi> And they that payed to the Trea≈øure of the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi> were called
<hi>Tributaries of the Grand Seignior.</hi> The fir≈øt ≈øort of Tribute is very moderate, becau≈øe it ≈øeldom amounted to above two <hi>Pia≈øters;</hi> but the la≈øt hath always been, and is yet, one hundred and twenty
<hi>Para's,</hi> that is, four <hi>Pia≈øters</hi> and a quarter. Be≈øides this, the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and Towns were taxed only in common: For Example, ≈øuch a Village was tax'd to pay ≈øuch a Sum, according to the number of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians that dwell there; and when the <hi>Chouli,</hi> or the Collector, went to receive it, he tax'd every one according to his ability: The poor paid lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the rich more; ≈øo that this Tribute was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:106091:92"/>
                  <p>But in this Year 1672. <hi>Ibrahim Pacha</hi> taxed them all as Tributaries to the Grand <hi>Seignior;</hi> and upon the ≈øame account cau≈øing them all to pay equally one hundred and twenty <hi>Para's;</hi> out of which the <hi>Pacha</hi> paid that which was due to the Lords and
<hi>Mo≈øques,</hi> and the re≈øt was put into the Grand <hi>Seigniors</hi> Coffers.</p>
                  <p>This novelty hath reduc'd the poor <hi>Copties</hi> to de≈øpair; therefore when the Collectors come into any Village to gather the Tribute, they fly to the Mountains, leaving all to ≈øecure them≈øelves from violence, and affronts that would be done to their Per≈øons.</p>
                  <p>That the Receivers of the Tribute might know them that have paid it, they leave a little Ticket of coloured Paper, ≈øealed with the Seal of their Chieftain, where the name of the Chri≈øtian is written, his Village, his Province, his Dwelling, his Age, the Day, the Month, and the Year that he hath paid.</p>
                  <p>But they put not into this Ticket the whole Sum of one hundred and eight and twenty <hi>Para's,</hi> which they require, but only one hundred and three, becau≈øe there is no more that goes into the Trea≈øury of the Grand <hi>Seignior;</hi> the other five and twenty <hi>Meidins</hi> are for the Farmer of the <hi>Caraffe,</hi> paid to him becau≈øe of the great expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he is at, to entertain a great many Men for the di≈øcharge of his Office. The Chri≈øtians carry always with them this Ticket, to ≈øhew it when they are que≈øtioned by the Men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Farmer, and this is their Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>The 18th of <hi>September</hi> I bought, of an <hi>Arabian,</hi> a great <hi>Lizard,</hi> alive, called in their Language, <pb n="177" facs="tcp:106091:92"/>
                     <hi>Varal.</hi> I cau≈øed it to be skinned, and ≈øent the Skin to Mon≈øieur <hi>Arnoul,</hi> Superintendent of the Kings Galleys at
<hi>Mar≈øeilles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The body of this <hi>Lizard</hi> was altogether like that of the
<hi>Crocodile,</hi> the Skin excepted, which was gray and ≈øpotted, as that of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> and without any Shells. It was three-foot long, and had five Fingers to each Foot, and long white Nails, as have the
<hi>Crocodiles.</hi> Its Tongue was forked as that of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> the Headlong, and the Muzzle ≈øharp. Its Teeth were ≈øtrong, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; the
<hi>Arabians</hi> told me, that its biting was venomous and deadly.</p>
                  <p>I have ≈øince recover'd another of a differing ≈øort, when I was in the Mona≈øtery of S. <hi>Anthony.</hi> The Head of this was like that of a <hi>Tortell,</hi> and its Tail very big, and le≈ø≈øening by degrees, and ending into a ≈ømall point. It was full of knots round about, as ≈øo many Shells. This <hi>Lizard</hi> was not venomous, for I took it with my Hand, and when I had well con≈øider'd it, I gave it to an <hi>Arabian</hi> Dog that eat it.</p>

                  <p>There is two ways that lead from this Village <hi>Beiha,</hi> to this Mona≈øtery.

                  </p>
                  <p>About a days Journey farther is another, at the left hand of the High-way, at the foot of a high Mountain, called <hi>Gebel il cheleil;</hi> but its Water is noi≈øome and green, and the We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Arabian</hi> called <hi>Eid il beidavi;</hi> but the <hi>Caravan</hi> never goes thither but when they want Water, becau≈øe it ≈øtands from the High-way, at a di≈øtance: Therefore when they are furni≈øhed with Water at the ≈øecond Well, they pa≈øs at the left hand ≈øtreight to the Mona≈øtery.</p>
                  <p>The upper way leads from <hi>Beiha</hi> towards the

<hi>Blackamoor.</hi> Be≈øides the≈øe, I took with me five <hi>Arabians,</hi> armed with Lances, to go on foot, and take charge of the Camels; and to protect us, if perchance any Robbers ≈øhould have a≈ø≈øaulted us; ≈øo that we were in all ten in number, and five Camels. When we had got all that was needful for the Voyage, we went from <hi>Beiha</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> the 30th of
<hi>September,</hi> about three a Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:106091:94"/>
                  <p>Though the under way was the ≈øhorte≈øt, and the mo≈øt frequented, yet we cho≈øe the upper way, that we might not meet with the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> the declared Enemies of tho≈øe that conducted us. When we had travelled four days through a boundle≈øs Plain of Sand, which was not move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but hard, and full of ≈øharp cutting ≈øtones, that cut as ≈øo many Razors, we arrived at la≈øt, through a thou≈øand turnings, to the Mona≈øtery, the third day of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Mona≈øtery of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> which includes another, anciently peopled by the <hi>Aby≈ø≈øins,</hi> and now totally ruinated, is in the Wilderne≈øs, now called in <hi>Arab. Gebel Araba,</hi> or the Mountain of Carts; becau≈øe heretofore Provi≈øions were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thither upon Carts, and not upon Camels, as now.</p>
                  <p>It is built upon the decline of the Mount <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi> at its <hi>Ea≈øtern</hi> end, which reaches from <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> to
<hi>South:</hi> It appears like a long Square; and the Front of the Mona≈øtery, which ≈øtretches from <hi>North-Ea≈øt</hi> to <hi>North,</hi> looks again≈øt another Mountain called <hi>Gebel il Cheleil,</hi> of which I ≈øhall ≈øpeak hereafter.</p>
                  <p>It is incompa≈ø≈øed in with an high Mountain, but feeble, and unable to make any re≈øi≈øtance; for it is old, and built with Bricks dried in the Sun. There is no Gate to the Mona≈øtery, one enters in by a Pulley, Men and Bea≈øts are all drawn up over the Wall.</p>
                  <p>It hath a large Circuit, about ≈øix hundred <hi>Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans,</hi> or two thou≈øand four hundred Acres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls.</p>
                  <p>The Monks of the <hi>Levant</hi> dwell not together in the ≈øame Cells, as tho≈øe of <hi>Europe,</hi> but every <pb n="182" facs="tcp:106091:95"/>one hath a little Hou≈øe or Cell to him≈øelf, and the≈øe Cells are more or le≈øs beautiful and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, according as the Country hath experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the cruelty of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Therefore the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na≈øteries of the
<hi>Levant,</hi> and chiefly tho≈øe of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> are like ≈øo many great Towns or Ca≈øtles, becau≈øe of their Walls, Turrets, and number of hou≈øes that are within; but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na≈øteries of <hi>Egypt</hi> have nothing of that ≈øplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, becau≈øe the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have been here more cruel than in any other Country ≈øubject to them. Neverthele≈øs, this Mona≈øtery is like tho≈øe of <hi>Greece,</hi> for it is ≈øurrounded with Walls: In the middle is a Dungeon, and round about many Hou≈øes where the Monks live; but in regard it has been de≈øtroyed long ago by the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> it hath remain'd in that condition three≈øcore and ten years: The <hi>Copties</hi> who have lo≈øt, under the tyranny of the
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> all their ≈øtrength and power, could never yet re≈øtore it to its former e≈øtate.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Cells now are very little, and poor, of yellowi≈øh Earth, without Timber, Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, Order, or Symmetry: they are ≈øo low, that a man may ea≈øily reach up to the top with his hand: therefore the Monks cannot well ≈øtand upright: there is a little light that enters in through holes in the wall, about a foot long; the doors are ≈øo low, that one mu≈øt ≈øtoop low to go in; that which is mo≈øt commodious, is that they have all flat roofs for the Monks to take the air at night, when the Sun is gone, and to ≈øleep when they plea≈øe.</p>
                  <p>Their dining-place is very dirty, and ob≈øcure: There is for Strangers a place of it ≈øelf, large <pb n="183" facs="tcp:106091:95"/>and decent, with two other Chambers hard by to put their Goods and Cloaths; and a little Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin.</p>
                  <p>The Gardens are very large, and great, and con≈øiderable, becau≈øe of the Herbs and Fruits that they bring forth. One might make of them the mo≈øt plea≈øant Gardens of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of their convenient ≈øcituations, for they lie ≈øhelving, with beautiful Plains.</p>
                  <p>There are two ≈ømall Vines that yield a ≈øort of White-wine, very delightful: They u≈øe it in ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ma≈øs, and in treating Strangers of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that come thither.</p>
                  <p>In this Mona≈øtery is a great quantity of fre≈øh water, as clear as Cry≈øtal, but very ≈øalt. It runs from the Mount <hi>Colzim,</hi> near by, in little ≈øtreams, under the Walls, into the Gardens, where they receive it in places made on purpo≈øe. They drink it, and make other u≈øes of it. It is not very whole≈øome, chiefly for tho≈øe that are not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtomed to it; for the <hi>Niter</hi> that infects it, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth Bladders to ri≈øe under the Skin, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ≈øuch as drink of it with itching, as I have found by experience.</p>
                  <p>Here are three Churches, the chief is that of S.
<hi>Anthony;</hi> it is little, but very ancient; and as the Monks told me, it is the ≈øame that S. <hi>Anthony</hi> built, and the only thing of the Mona≈øtery that hath e≈øcap'd the rage of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> Within are Pictures of many Saints, painted in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and ≈øimple fa≈øhion: The ≈ømoak of the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincen≈øe that is burnt there at Divine Service, hath made them appear as black as a Chimney.</p>
                  <p>Near this Church is another dedicated to S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> within a little Tower, and one <pb n="184" facs="tcp:106091:96"/>Bell, about a foot and a half in Diameter: ≈øerves to call the Monks to the Service of God, and to their other imployments. There is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bell in all
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Church is in the Garden, dedicated to a Lay Monk, called <hi>Mark,</hi> who died with a Reputation of Holine≈øs; his body is kept there.</p>
                  <p>In the middle of the Mona≈øtery there is a ≈øquare Tower, with ≈øtone Walls, very ≈øtrong; from the bottom of the Tower to the Gate, which is about three Perches high, it is very firm: on the top is a Draw-bridge that leads to this Gate; but to come to it, one mu≈øt climb up to the top of an hou≈øe, over again≈øt it. In this Tower the Monks keep all their Provi≈øions, and their be≈øt Moveables; and they fly to it when the Rogui≈øh
<hi>Arabians</hi> threaten them: They then draw the Bridge, and beat them off with Stones from the Plat-form.</p>
                  <p>Their Rule obliges them to renounce Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for ever, all carnal de≈øires, their Parents, to po≈ø≈øe≈øs no E≈øtate, to dwell in the Wilderne≈øs, to be cloathed with Wooll, to be girt with a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Girdle, to eat no Fle≈øh, nor drink Wine all their life-time, unle≈øs they be reduc'd to the la≈øt nece≈ø≈øity, to ≈øhorten their dinner, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them≈øelves all the nouri≈øhments without which the body is able to live. It commands them to imploy all their time in fa≈øting, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and wor≈øhip, to have always their mind run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon God, to apply them≈øelves to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Scriptures, and to under≈øtand the Truths that are there contain'd.</p>
                  <p>It obliges them to ≈øleep upon a Mat, or the ground, their Superiour excepted, and ≈øuch as <pb n="185" facs="tcp:106091:96"/>are ≈øick; not to take off their Cloaths, and their Girdle, never to ≈øleep two upon the ≈øame Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nor near one another. In ≈øhort, their Rules oblige them to repeat the Canonical Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to pro≈øtrate them≈øelves before they go to Bed, one hundred and fifty times, with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Bellies to the ground, to ≈øpread out their arms in a cro≈øs, with the fi≈øt ≈øhut, and at every ri≈øing to make the Sign of the Cro≈øs; which Pro≈øtrations they call
<hi>Metanoe.</hi> Be≈øides the≈øe one hundred and fifty Pro≈øtrations, they perform ≈øeven at the Church; one before every Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prayer, which make up in all one hundred and fifty ≈øeven Pro≈øtrations; which together with the poor nouri≈øhment that their bodies take, renders them very lean, and ca≈øt down; ≈øo that they appear like ≈øo many Skelletons, rather than men.</p>
                  <p>Their Cloaths are fir≈øt a Shirt of white Wooll, which they wear always upon their skin. 2. A Wa≈øtcoat of brown Wooll, very cour≈øe, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before. 3. A Ve≈øt of black Serge, with two large Sleeves. 4. Their Capuchin is likewi≈øe of black Serge, very little, and made fit to the Head.
5. Their Girdle is of Leather, three ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers broad. 6. The <hi>Mezerre,</hi> called by the <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and ≈øometimes
<hi>Biggos,</hi> is a great Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of black Stuff, lined with white, like the Cloaks of the <hi>Je≈øuites,</hi> only it is without Collar; unle≈øs it be when they Travel, they ≈øeldom u≈øe it. The 7. is <hi>Askim,</hi> or the

                     </gap>, which few of the Monks wear, becau≈øe they have not ≈øtrength enough, as they ≈øay, to do the Penance that the Canons have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to it; for they that bear it, are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <pb n="186" facs="tcp:106091:97"/>to pro≈øtrate their Face and Belly to the ground, with their arms a-cro≈øs, three hundred times every night before they ≈øleep, be≈øides the fa≈øting, and other mortifications thereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd. I have ≈øent one of the≈øe <hi>Askims</hi> to the Kings Library, which
<hi>Amba Michel,</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Fium,</hi> gave me as a token of his love.</p>
                  <p>They carry always a ≈øtick in their hands, made in the form of a <hi>Tan,</hi> T, upon which they lean when they are at their prayers; for they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them ≈øtanding, and are very tedious in them. They have all upon their heads a Bonnet, called in <hi>Arab. Cauk,</hi> which is like that which the <hi>Mahometans</hi> wear; about which they wrap a Turbant of a Stuff ≈øtraked with blew and white, which is the colour of all the <hi>Copties</hi> in <hi>Egypt:</hi> They never wear any Stockings, nor their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch.</p>
                  <p>The Fa≈øt-days they ob≈øerve, by eating then but one Meal; but on the <hi>Saturdays</hi> and <hi>Sundays</hi> they never fa≈øt, but eat twice. On the Fa≈øt-days they dine con≈øtantly about three a Clock in the Afternoon; then they end Ma≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Their ordinary diet are Pul≈øe and Herbs ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoned with the ≈øtinking Oyl of Hemp: For their De≈ø≈øerts they have Fruits, as Onyons, dried Dates, rotten Olives, Melons, or Cucumbers, or Pompions, or ≈øuch like Fruits as are in ≈øea≈øon.</p>
                  <p>They never eat Fle≈øh in the Mona≈øtery; but when they are out they may eat it; for their Founder never forbad them, as they ≈øay: For fre≈øh Fi≈øh they ≈øeldom have any, becau≈øe their Mona≈øtery is ≈øo far di≈øtant from <hi>Nilus,</hi> and there is no convenient carriage to bring them any. And though the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> be within a little days
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106091:97"/>Journey, they cannot have any fre≈øh Fi≈øh, becau≈øe the Sea-coa≈øt being not inhabited, they have no In≈øtruments to catch Fi≈øh; and the ways are dangerous, becau≈øe of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Rogues and Robbers.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Ea≈øter</hi> they never fa≈øt, but eat Eggs and Milk, which are ≈øent to them from their Farm; only three times a year they have liberty to drink Wine, at <hi>Chri≈øtmas,</hi> at <hi>Ea≈øter,</hi> and
<hi>Penteco≈øt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ≈øleep always in their Cloaths; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of a Blanket, they have only a Mat, very cour≈øe, made with Palm-leaves, and ≈øtretched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long upon the ground. They are the makers of them; they call them in <hi>Arab. Bur≈øch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their imployments are not the ≈øame, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every mans ability: Some manure and dre≈øs the Gardens, others are Cooks, others grind at the Mill; ≈øome are upon the Guard, to give notice when any Travellers go by, or come, and others are appointed to draw up tho≈øe that will come in, and let down tho≈øe that de≈øire to depart; ≈øuch as have no imployment, make Mats.</p>
                  <p>They never ≈øtudy; they are ≈øatisfied in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Books of Devotion: among≈øt the re≈øt, they read often the <hi>Synaxar,</hi> or
<hi>Book of Martyrs;</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radi≈øe of Monks,</hi> the
<hi>Climax,</hi> or <hi>the Ladder of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> of <hi>John, Abbot of the Mona≈øtery of Mount Sinai;</hi> the Sermons of <hi>Paul de Bu≈øch,</hi> upon the Fe≈øtivals of the Ble≈ø≈øed Virgin, and ≈øuch like. When I was there, I ≈øaw but two Prie≈øts, the Vicar of the Mona≈øtery was one; and the other, who had not ≈øaid his fir≈øt Ma≈øs, was the Steward. All the others, that were ≈øeventeen in number, were Lay-men, and almo≈øt all either with one eye,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106091:98"/>deaf, lame, and halt, or worn out with old age; and if among≈øt them any were young, he did but ≈øeek the opportunity to e≈øcape from ≈øuch au≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
                  <p>In the Tower, mentioned before, were three or ≈øour Trunks full of old <hi>Arabian</hi> Manu≈øcripts, and ≈øome in the <hi>Copties</hi> Language, which I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd: And though they were all Books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion belonging to the Church, ≈øome of them de≈øerved to be in the Kings Library; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Monks were not willing to fell them, for they belong'd to the Mona≈øtery, fearing the Excommunication of their Patriarch, which is written in the beginning of every Book; and becau≈øe I had brought with me but ≈øo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as was needful for my Journey, for fear of the Thieves, I was not very earne≈øt to buy them.</p>
                  <p>Two among≈øt the re≈øt were very curious, which I had a great de≈øire to have; one was the <hi>Copties</hi> Grammar and Dictionary in
<hi>Arabick,</hi> of <hi>Ibn il a≈ø≈øal.</hi> It was one of the exacte≈øt and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt that ever I faw: They e≈øteem'd it worth thirty Crowns; I dare ≈øay, that with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionary and Grammar it is po≈ø≈øible to re-e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øh the <hi>Copties</hi> Language, which now is lo≈øt: The other Book was a <hi>Rubrick of their Ceremonies</hi> in <hi>Folio,</hi> very well written.</p>
                  <p>In regard the <hi>Arabians</hi> are the Ma≈øters of the Wilderne≈øs, this Mona≈øtery is obliged to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all that come thither, or pa≈øs by, whether Friends or Foes: To their Friends they pay this ho≈øpitality to pre≈øerve their friend≈øhip, and to their Enemies they perform it, to plea≈øe them, and hinder them from doing them a mi≈øchief. They treat not all in the ≈øame manner; for their <pb n="189" facs="tcp:106091:98"/>Friends they take them in with their Equipage, when they have need, and they nouri≈øh them all the time that they de≈øire to live there; but their Enemies never enter in, but receive from them, by a Basket let down from the Wall, all nece≈ø≈øaries.</p>
                  <p>They are often vi≈øited by the≈øe <hi>Arabians,</hi> ≈øo that they ≈øpend every year a great deal of Meal, of Bread, of Bisket, of Barly, of Beans and Lentils, and other Provi≈øions. I ≈øhall not mention the trouble that the Monks ≈øuffer, and the di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures that they receive from the≈øe ungrateful Wretches, who commonly recompen≈øe them with affronts, and filthy ≈øpeeches.</p>
                  <p>And becau≈øe the <hi>Arabians</hi> that inhabit about
<hi>Egypt</hi> are of divers Families, and differing Intere≈øts; they have ≈øo great a hatred for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they never meet without fighting.</p>
                  <p>Such a mi≈øchance happen'd the next day after my arrival; for the <hi>Caravan</hi> of the Summer, of fifty Camels, loaden with Provi≈øions for the Mona≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, led by thirteen Hor≈ømen of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> named
<hi>Beneva≈øel,</hi> arrived that day. They were watched by other
<hi>Arabians,</hi> named <hi>Ababde,</hi> their Enemies. And becau≈øe it was the time that the Dates began to be ripe upon the Trees, ≈øome of them when they had unloaden would not return the ≈øame day, with their Companions, to their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and Cabbins, but remain'd behind in the Mona≈øtery, to take their plea≈øure a day or two. It happen'd the next night that tho≈øe that ≈ølept out of the Mona≈øtery, about their Bea≈øts, were ≈øurpris'd at midnight, by a Company of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcore <hi>Arabians,</hi> called
<hi>Ababde,</hi> who took from them fifteen Camels, and ≈øeven Hor≈øes, all their Equipage, and kill'd three of them, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="190" facs="tcp:106091:99"/>five, of whom one dyed within three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and another was lo≈øt, none knowing what was become of him; for four days after his Hor≈øe was found alone in the Wilderne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Their fury ended not with this Butchery; for they pur≈øued, with the ≈øame heat, tho≈øe that had brought me to the Mona≈øtery. They overtook but four, and carryed away from them their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, all their Equipage, and Money that I had given them, and wounded three very dangerou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ≈øo that the≈øe Wretches being not able, in this ≈øad condition, to proceed on in their Journey, they return'd back to the Mona≈øtery all naked, and in a pitiful manner. They were afraid to appear before me, becau≈øe they had fal≈øified their Faith, contrary to the Laws of their Nation, and broken their agreement with me, in making me pay five and twenty <hi>Meidins</hi> more than I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with them. Their Con≈øcience did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them of this ba≈øene≈øs, ≈øo that they imagin'd that this mi≈øchance happen'd to them to puni≈øh their perfideou≈øne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ≈øufficiently expre≈øs how much trouble this unhappine≈øs created me, as well as to the Monks; for the≈øe
<hi>Arabians</hi> were enraged, ≈øome for the lo≈øs of their Parents and Friends, others for their Goods, which they were re≈øolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover upon me and the Monks. They threatned to kill them, to plunder the Mona≈øtery; and out of a per≈øwa≈øion that I was a very rich <hi>Franc,</hi> they threatned to break open my Door, and carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all that I had. So that the Monks had much ado to pacifie them, by giving the Shirts, Cloaths, Caps, Girdles, in a word, all that they wanted; and when they had nothing more left to give<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:106091:99"/>they came to me, intreating me to help them in their need; ≈øo that I was oblig'd to give them a Coat, and a Shirt to bury an
<hi>Arabian</hi> that dyed in the Mona≈øtery. I gave them a red Cap, a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, Money very often, that I might not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by tho≈øe Monks who deliver'd all to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> without telling them from whence it came.</p>
                  <p>But at la≈øt the <hi>Arabians</hi> were jealous, when they ≈øaw that I continued ≈øhut up, without ≈øhewing my ≈øelf abroad, either to them, or any other of the Mona≈øtery; and my privacy made them believe that I was ≈øome great Per≈øon that was afraid of them. They re≈øolved therefore to give me a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øit, to know who I was. As ≈øoon as the Vicar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood their intent, he came to give me notice of it, that I might take a cour≈øe accordingly. As ≈øoon as I under≈øtood it, I cau≈øed all my Goods to be carried into the Tower of the Mona≈øtery, leaving nothing in my Chamber but a cour≈øe Mat of Palm Leaves ≈øtretched upon the Floor, upon which I ≈øate without Carpet or Cu≈øhion: And that they might not think me to be a
<hi>Franc,</hi> I took the Habit of a Monk of that Convent. In this manner I expected them, not without fear. The next day about noon, three of the chief enter'd into my Chamber with their <hi>Cangians,</hi> or
<hi>Cutla≈ø≈øes,</hi> at their Girdle in their Bo≈øoms. They ≈øaluted me with a ≈øurly look, asking how I did. I an≈øwer'd their civility as well as I could; I cau≈øed them to ≈øit down near me, and told them that I was griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their misfortune, and that I was not able to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them in their need. I exhorted them to tru≈øt upon God and S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was as well their Father and Protector, as of the Monks; <pb n="192" facs="tcp:106091:100"/>and that doubtle≈øs he would comfort them, and give them one day the opportunity to overcome their Enemies. The≈øe words plea≈øed the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> mightily.</p>
                  <p>I caus'd my Dinner to be brought, and though I had with me all my Provi≈øions needful from <hi>Cairo,</hi> I ≈øuffered nothing to be brought but Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils in a Wooden Di≈øh, with Bread ≈øoaked in it, and a few Onions, I intreated them to eat ≈øome with me: They needed not much invitation. One may imagine what was in my mind, when I had ≈øuch Gue≈øs at my Table; but fear cau≈øed me to di≈ø≈øemble my thoughts.</p>
                  <p>After Dinner I gave them Pipes to take Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, and Coffee according to the Mode of the Country, which plea≈øed them well, chiefly in this place where little of that Drink was to be ≈øeen. When the≈øe
<hi>Arabians</hi> ≈øaw me ≈øo free and hearty, they conceived ≈øuch an affection for me, that they promis'd to protect me, if any of their Comrades ≈øhould offer to affront me. When they had talked with me ≈øome hours, they went away very well ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and told their Comrades how civil I had been. By this one may under≈øtand, that there is no Nation in the World ≈øo barbarous; but is to be won by fair means.</p>
                  <p>Some days before; the <hi>Arabians</hi> had ≈øent ≈øome of their Company to their Parents, to inform them of their lo≈øs, and to intreat them to ≈øend them Bea≈øts to help home their ≈øick and wounded. That day they received an an≈øwer, that ≈øuch of them as could return home on foot ≈øhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that the others ≈øhould continue there till they were cured of their wounds; and that none dur≈øt come, or ≈øend them Bea≈øts, for fear of lo≈øing <pb n="193" facs="tcp:106091:100"/>them. Therefore the≈øe Wretches when they ≈øaw that they could not remain any longer in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na≈øtery, re≈øolved to depart together, as ≈øoon as their ≈øick Per≈øons ≈øhould recover any ≈øtrength. I re≈øolved al≈øo to be gone; for the little ≈øatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I found there, took away all de≈øire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue there any longer; for I had cau≈øe to fear, le≈øt the news of this Ma≈ø≈øacre ≈øhould ≈øpread about the Wilderne≈øs, which might have cau≈øed me to ≈øtay there all the Winter, for want of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to carry me away. I ha≈øten'd therefore my departure as much as I could, and hired three Camels of an <hi>Arabian</hi> that was left behind in the Mona≈øtery, who alone was able to furni≈øh us: I was to give him a <hi>Pia≈øter</hi> and a half a-piece; moreover I promis'd to give him a new Suit of Apparel for an <hi>Arabian</hi> of our Company that had been ≈øtripp'd, who≈øe Kin≈øman he ≈øaid he was: We confirm'd our Agreement before all the Monks, by the Chapter of <hi>Fatha,</hi> according to the Cu≈øtom of the Country; and then I cau≈øed my ≈øelf to be let down from the Window of the Mona≈øtery, on <hi>Munday</hi> the 17th of
<hi>October,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with joy a place where I had met with many di≈øplea≈øures. We took the way and road of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> or the under way, becau≈øe the Camels that I had hired lived that way. The
<hi>Arabian</hi> that was to be my Guide having but one in the Mona≈øtery, the two others being near his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was in a Clift of Mount <hi>Gebel il che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leil,</hi> over again≈øt the Mona≈øtery. We went to this Lodging, or about a days travelling from thence, in a way very difficult and deep; and becau≈øe this <hi>Arabian</hi> was a right Devil of the Mountains, as they term them≈øelves in boa≈øting. <pb n="194" facs="tcp:106091:101"/>As ≈øoon as we were a little forwards in our way, he told me that the Price that we had agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not ≈øufficient, and that I mu≈øt promi≈øe him as much more. I refu≈øed to grant him his de≈øire, which was contrary to all rea≈øon and ju≈øtice, he led us therefore two days up and down in the Wilderne≈øs, ≈øometimes one way, ≈øometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, threatning to leave us and go away with his Camel, or to carry us back to the Mona≈øtery: all this was to force me to give him what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. I had much difficulty to hold my hands from ≈øtriking him, which I had done, had we but known the way, and where to recover Water; but con≈øidering that I was lo≈øt if I did abu≈øe him, I was forced at la≈øt to con≈øent to his de≈øire, upon this Condition, that he ≈øhould remain at home and give us another Per≈øon to guide us in our way; for he was of ≈øuch a crooked di≈øpo≈øition that it was impo≈ø≈øible to perform the Journey peaceably with him, which accordingly he did. When we had thus ≈øatisfied him, he became of a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and led us to his Dwelling, where his Wife and Children came to ≈øee us, and prepared for us a Supper, according to the Mode of the <hi>Arabians;</hi> his Boys brought us ≈øome Wild-Fowl, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented me with a young Fawn alive, which I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with me to
<hi>Cairo.</hi> Thus we ≈øpent that night very plea≈øantly.</p>
                  <p>The next day we cau≈øed him to repeat the <hi>Fatha</hi> the ≈øecond time. He gave us a <hi>Moor</hi> to conduct us, of a very good humour. We went with him on our way, and arrived at <hi>Bei≈øa</hi> the 22th of
<hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> from whence we had been ab≈øent 22 days. I pa≈ø≈øed immediately over to the other ≈øide of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to <hi>Bene≈øuef,</hi> and lodg'd under a Tent, with a <pb n="195" facs="tcp:106091:101"/>
                     <hi>Turk</hi> my very good Friend, on the ≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> till the 26th of
<hi>October.</hi> I went aboard then to return to <hi>Cairo,</hi> where I landed the next day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ≈øpent 31 days in my Travels from thence.</p>
                  <p>I never undertook any Journey, or Voyage, that was ≈øo full of accidents, and cro≈ø≈øes, as this.</p>
                  <p>The conveniency of a Guide cau≈øed me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it. He was a young <hi>Aby≈ø≈øin,</hi> of my Age, named <hi>Paul,</hi> a comly Per≈øon, wi≈øe and devout in appearance. I had a little before got acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him; and becau≈øe he under≈øtood by my di≈øcour≈øe, that I had a great de≈øire to vi≈øit the Mona≈øtery of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> where he ≈øaid he had been before, and that I expected but a Guide, becau≈øe the ways were difficult for a <hi>Franc</hi> who had never been there, chiefly becau≈øe of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> a bruti≈øh and fanta≈øtick People, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his ≈øervice to accompany me thither. And the rather I accepted his offer; becau≈øe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had a particular re≈øpect for the hone≈øt Men of his Country.</p>
                  <p>We re≈øolved therefore upon all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of our Journey, and left <hi>Cairo</hi> the day mentioned before. But the familiarity ordinary among≈øt fellow Travellers di≈øcovered to me his di≈øpo≈øition and temper, more than I could before; for all his vi≈øits at <hi>Cairo</hi> were ≈øtudied and crafty. I found therefore that he was a di≈ø≈øembler, and without judgment, too ha≈øty; I re≈øolved therefore to ≈øhake him off, and to ≈øeek another, to prevent the mi≈øchiefs that his indi≈øcretion might procure tome.</p>
                  <p>I met at <hi>Bene≈øuef,</hi> very happily, a <hi>Coptie</hi> born at <hi>Bu≈øch,</hi> by Profe≈ø≈øion a <hi>Meba≈øcier,</hi> or Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, who had travell'd all about the upper <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:106091:102"/>I found him fit for my turn, I ask'd him to be my Guide in this Voyage; he accepted of the offer, and I paid him beforehand. When the
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by≈ø≈øin</hi> under≈øtood it, he was highly offended; ≈øo that he endeavour'd afterwards to be reveng'd, by cau≈øing a di≈øturbance among≈øt us, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd the Company again≈øt him.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt night after our departure from <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuef,</hi> when we lay in the Wilderne≈øs, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my Servant, contrary to my orders, to give no Coffee to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> as if a Di≈øh of Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, given to the≈øe Wretches, would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveri≈øh'd me. They plotted to cut his Throat, and doubtle≈øs he had there ended his days, had I not perceived it betimes and ≈øatisfied them; for as they are extreme bruti≈øh when they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd, they are very quiet when they are flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd and kindly us'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> caus'd me, again≈øt their wills, to ≈øuffer another inconveniency. They took no care when they greas'd the Leathern Bottles of Water, that the Grea≈øe was mouldy, it infected therefore the Water ≈øo much which we were to drink, that I could not po≈ø≈øibly ta≈øte of it: let any Man think if this was not a ≈øufficient mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ≈øeeing our Journey, or Voyage, la≈øted five days.</p>
                  <p>As this was the fir≈øt time that I rid upon a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, I could hardly endure the ≈øhakings, which the manner of walking of this fanta≈øtick Bea≈øt cau≈øed me to ≈øuffer. I confe≈øs, when I ≈øaw my ≈øelf upon this Colo≈ø≈øus, without any ≈øtay, lifted up in the Air, ≈øeated upon an ugly Bea≈øt; my Feet in two Ropes in≈øtead of Stirrups, holding in my hand a Cord made with the Strings of a Palm-tree, <pb n="197" facs="tcp:106091:102"/>which cut my hands, it ≈øeemed to me very ≈øtrange: I re≈øolved neverthele≈øs to overcome all the≈øe difficulties; and in≈øtead of vexing my ≈øelf, I made a ≈øport of that which would have troubled other Per≈øons.</p>
                  <p>When I think upon the ≈øolemn reception of the Monks, when I fir≈øt came into the Mona≈øtery, I cannot but be yet di≈øpleas'd at my
<hi>Aby≈ø≈øin.</hi> This Fool de≈øired me to let him go before the
<hi>Caravan,</hi> to tell the Monks of my coming, and to cau≈øe a Chamber to be prepared for me; but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects they paid me, I under≈øtood that he had too much exaggerated my quality, thinking to do me a plea≈øure. I indeavoured to undeceive them, and cau≈øed all their Ceremonies to cea≈øe, as ≈øoon as I perceived that they took me for a greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon than really I was.</p>
                  <p>I have already ≈øet down at large how the
<hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b√Øans</hi> frighted me in the Mona≈øtery; but they were not the only Per≈øons that troubled me. The Monks, the Vicars, the <hi>Copties,</hi> and the <hi>Aby≈ø≈øins</hi> vex'd me one after another, as if they had all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to try my patience.</p>
                  <p>The avaricious Monks, not contented with what I had given them, before my departure cau≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Vicar to tell me, that they expected that a
<hi>Franc</hi> of my reputation would have left them at lea≈øt thirty golden
<hi>Ducats</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> When I told them of the great charges I had been at in this Voyage, be≈øides the expences that I was yet to be at in my return; that I had received but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ≈øatisfaction from them; that I wonder'd at their boldne≈øs, to tax a Stranger of my quality, that came from far to ≈øee their mi≈øerable Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery, and their poverty. They were angry at <pb n="198" facs="tcp:106091:103"/>this an≈øwer, and treated me afterwards with contempt.</p>
                  <p>The Vicar was afraid to want Bread in his Mona≈øtery; therefore he re≈øolved to quit it, and to ≈øeek another where he might be better treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And becau≈øe he had no money to hire a Camel to carry him through a tedious and trouble≈øome way, he intreated me to give him ≈øome, which I did very generou≈øly, though I had cau≈øe to be offended with him. But he put this money in his Pur≈øe, without dreaming of hiring a Camel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that my men would ≈øuffer him to ride ≈øometimes upon their Camels: But in the way he found him≈øelf deceived; when he was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his feet cut with the ≈øharp ≈øtones, he mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured at me; I told him of his covetou≈øne≈øs, unworthy of a man of his Profe≈ø≈øion, of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle love for his Flock, whom he left in the time when they needed mo≈øt his Fatherly care, but he received the≈øe reproofs very ill; ≈øo that from thence it may ea≈øily be imagin'd, how we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd together.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aby≈ø≈øin</hi> and the <hi>Coptie</hi> were at a continual variance, becau≈øe one thought him≈øelf more u≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me than the other; ≈øo that at every foot, I was oblig'd to make peace between them.</p>
                  <p>The night before the <hi>Arabians</hi> vi≈øited me, I was oblig'd to cau≈øe all my Cloaths to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Tower of the Mona≈øtery, into a ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure place. In that hurley-burley I lo≈øt ≈øome, valued at five or ≈øix <hi>Pia≈øters;</hi> I cannot tell who≈øe fault it was, the <hi>Aby≈ø≈øin</hi> ca≈øt the fault upon the <hi>Coptie,</hi> to di≈øcredit him with me: However, as ≈øoon as we were come to <hi>Beiha,</hi> the <hi>Coptie</hi> vani≈øh'd away ≈øuddenly, without bidding us farewell.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106091:103"/>This cau≈øed me to ≈øu≈øpect that the
<hi>Aby≈ø≈øin</hi> had not accu≈øed him wrongfully.</p>
                  <p>To all the≈øe di≈øplea≈øures we mu≈øt add the fear of Thieves in the way; for at every ≈øtep, we look'd on the ground to ≈øee whether there were any foot≈øteps in the Sand; when we ≈øaw ≈øome that were fre≈øh, we were then grievou≈øly afraid; but our apprehen≈øions increa≈øed, when we ≈øaw the foot≈øteps turned our way, for we imagin'd that we ≈øhould meet them; fear alone made us take Bea≈øts at a di≈øtance for Men, and Bu≈øhes for Robbers that waited for us.</p>
                  <p>At la≈øt we were in ≈øight of <hi>Beiha,</hi> we imagin'd then that all our fears were over; but the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels knowing the Fields where they were wont to feed, began to leap for joy, becau≈øe they were return'd to their ordinary Pa≈øtures; ≈øo that the Saddle of that upon which I rid being not well girded, nor the Bridle ≈øufficient to ≈øtop the Bea≈øt, it jolted, and ca≈øt me up into the Air ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times: at every moment I thought I ≈øhould tumble down, and break my Neck, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd not, through the care of the <hi>Arabian</hi> that ≈øtopt the Camel.</p>
                  <p>This Relation is ≈øufficient to make it appear, that if there is ≈øome plea≈øure in travelling, and ≈øeeing Forreign Curio≈øities, one buys them very dear, with the hazard of many dangers and cro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, chiefly in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where cruelty and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øm ≈øeem to dwell.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall add ≈øome other Curio≈øities which I have ≈øeen in the De≈øarts.</p>
                  <p>We left at our left hand when we came from the Mona≈øteries, the ruines of a very ancient Town, ≈øcituate on the top of the barren Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <pb n="200" facs="tcp:106091:104"/>called, <hi>Gebel il cheleil.</hi> This Town is in the mid-way between <hi>Beiha</hi> and the Mona≈øtery, in that place where the Mountain ≈øeparates it ≈øelf, and by which one pa≈ø≈øeth in coming or going from <hi>Beiha,</hi> in the way of the <hi>Caravan.</hi> The
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> were ignorant of the name, and we had no time to ≈øtay there, having taken notice upon the Sand, of fre≈øh foot≈øteps of Hor≈øe-men that had pa≈ø≈øed that way, which cau≈øed us to conceive ≈øome danger, if we continued there any time.</p>
                  <p>I found there a Plant, which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call
<hi>Barnub:</hi> It hath a little full Stalk, as a <hi>Mouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and at the top a little Butron, about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of a Nut, which is full of Powder, which the <hi>Dyers</hi> u≈øe in dying. Its leaves are as ≈ølender as the leaves of Poppy; I gathered three or four of the≈øe Plants, but I could not keep them long, becau≈øe of their tenderne≈øs. I ≈øaw al≈øo an Herb which is called by the <hi>Arabians Rabl,</hi> that ≈ømells as <hi>Mint,</hi> my <hi>Arabians</hi> fed upon it. I ≈øaw there a great deal of
<hi>Alcali,</hi> called in <hi>Arab. Kilu,</hi> which hath the virtue to take away from Cloaths all manner of ≈øpots. Upon the Mount <hi>Colzim,</hi> there is a Wood that grows, called <hi>Oud il akrab,</hi> or <hi>Scorpions Wood,</hi> the Monks of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> reduced it to powder, which they judge to be a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy again≈øt the biting of venomous Creatures, as well as to cure weak eyes, and eyes inflamed: They gave me half a pound in Canes; I have ≈øent it to <hi>Paris</hi> with the other Curio≈øities. In this De≈øart is a great deal of <hi>Coloquinte,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sand much white ≈øalt very good, which my <hi>Arabians</hi> u≈øed to ≈øea≈øon their <hi>Fatir,</hi> and their
<hi>Mafruca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fatir</hi> are great Cakes, as thick as finger, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106091:104"/>as large as a <hi>French</hi> Hat, baked in the Coals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mafruca</hi> is made of the <hi>Fatir,</hi> by breaking it in pieces, when it is yet hot, and taken from the fire; and by pouring upon it Oyl-Olive, and kneading it with the hand in a wooden di≈øh, as if it were Pa≈øte. My <hi>Arabians</hi> imagin'd to do me a great plea≈øure to offer me ≈øome to eat, for this is highly e≈øteem'd among≈øt them; but though I had a good Stomach, I had not the courage to ta≈øte of it, for I had good cau≈øe to loath it.</p>
                  <p>I return now to ≈øpeak of the things that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd at
<hi>Cairo,</hi> where I landed the 30th of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctober.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That day they began the <hi>Zine,</hi> or <hi>Fe≈øtival of publick joy,</hi> becau≈øe the Grand Seignior had taken <hi>Caminiez</hi> from the <hi>Poles.</hi> This Fe≈øtival la≈øted from <hi>Sunday</hi> till
<hi>Thur≈øday</hi> in the Afternoon.</p>
                  <p>It is the cu≈øtom at <hi>Cairo,</hi> that in ≈øuch like Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtivals every one adorns the out-≈øide of his Hou≈øe or Shop with Carpets and Pavillions, lighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them all night many Lamps tyed to wooden Engines, ≈øome made in an <hi>Hexagone</hi> figure, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in an
<hi>Octogone;</hi> ≈øome as Stars, others in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner. The≈øe Engines are ≈øu≈øpended with Ropes tyed cro≈øs the Streets, which are beautiful to look upon. The Streets in all other times are ≈øhut in the night, but then are open, and the Chri≈øtians, during this Fe≈øtival, may walk about more freely than at other times at mid-day, becau≈øe one cannot di≈øtingui≈øh in that ob≈øcure light of what colour is the Turbant that they wear, nor di≈øcover whether it be ≈øtraked, or all white.</p>
                  <p>Be≈øides the≈øe Lamps and Carpets, the <hi>Beys</hi> hang up in a good order before their Palaces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <pb n="202" facs="tcp:106091:105"/>the Walls; their mo≈øt beautiful Armour, as Head-pieces, Brea≈øt-plates, Coats of Male, Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, Hangers, Targets, and other ≈øuch In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of War. The
<hi>French</hi> Con≈øuls, who never come ≈øhort of them, cau≈øe beautiful Carpets to be hung in all the Streets of their dwellings, and Pavillions over the Streets, from one end to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to keep off the heat of the Sun. Mon≈øieur <hi>de Tyger,</hi> Con≈øul of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, cau≈øed a kind of a re≈øting place to be erected, beautifying it with Carpets and Cu≈øhions, to receive the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of Quality; he put round about the Pictures of the King, of the Queen, of the Dolphin, and other <hi>French</hi> Lords, in ≈ømall ingravery, with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers before them, to cau≈øe the
<hi>Turks</hi> to admire the wit and invention of the <hi>French,</hi> who can make Pictures much like the Originals. But the <hi>Turks</hi> were ≈øurprized to ≈øee their Beards ≈øhaven off; they ask'd whether they were yet Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe Fe≈øtivals give much diver≈øion to the people, but they are very chargeable to tho≈øe that will ob≈øerve them, chiefly to the Con≈øuls; for be≈øides the Tents and Carpets, and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments that they mu≈øt hire, they are wont to give Coffee and Tobacco to all that come to ≈øee them; and if they be per≈øons of Quality, they mu≈øt have Sweet-meats: ≈øo that if a Con≈øul will come off with Honour, it will co≈øt him three or four hundred Crowns. The people run about the Streets, from morning till three hours after mid-night, all the time of the Fe≈øtival.</p>
                  <p>On the fir≈øt of <hi>November</hi> I went to ≈øee the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle of <hi>Cairo</hi> with a <hi>Chiaoux,</hi> a very good friend of mine.</p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:106091:105"/>
                  <p>The fir≈øt thing that we ≈øaw was the Royal Hall, where the
<hi>Pacha</hi> keeps the <hi>Divan.</hi> He ≈øhewed me in the middle of this Hall, a great Cord tyed double to one of the Beams of the Roof, where, according to the cu≈øtom of the Country, the <hi>Ca≈øciefs</hi> that have not ≈øufficient to pay the Taxes of their Province, at the end of the year are lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the air, with their hands behind, tyed to their backs: be≈øides, they are whipt upon their naked backs with a Whip of Cords, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto are tyed ≈øome Leaden Bullets.</p>
                  <p>We went up next to the top of the Ovens where they bake Bread, from whence the place called <hi>Kara,</hi> or the place of exerci≈øe, is di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable. There the <hi>Pacha</hi>'s men ≈øport them≈øelves with Bows and Arrows, and by running on Hor≈øe-back, aiming at a mark fixed at the top of a very high Tree.</p>
                  <p>We went to ≈øee next the Chambers where they make the Gun-powder, which are two great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours or Rooms on the ground, over again≈øt the Royal Hall of the <hi>Divan,</hi> with very ≈øtrong walls, and vaulted over head. In each are twelve Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of Pewter placed round, about a Cubit high, with their Pe≈øtels of Iron, which receive their motion, to pound the matter in the Mortars to powder, from a long Pole that an≈øwers to a Beam that ≈øtands in the middle of the Chamber, which a Hor≈øe turns round. There are near ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Chambers, where are many little Mortars, in which they refine the Gun-powder.</p>
                  <p>On the 19th of <hi>November</hi> I was pre≈øent at a Marriage of two <hi>Copties;</hi> the Ceremonies were performed in this manner.</p>
                  <p>After the Oration or Prayer of mid-night, or
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106091:106"/>as if we ≈øhould ≈øay, after Morning-prayer, the Friends and Parents led fir≈øt the Bridegroom, and next the Bride, from their Hou≈øes to the Church, with ≈øeveral lighted Tapers before them, and ≈øinging through the Streets Hymns in the <hi>Copties</hi> Language, and ≈øtriking with little wooden Hammers again≈øt ≈øome ≈øticks of Ebony wood, which is their Mu≈øick.</p>
                  <p>When they were come to the Church, they led the Bridegroom into the inner Chancel, where u≈øually the Prayers are ≈øaid, and brought the Bride to the place of the Women: Then the Prie≈øts and the People began in the Chancel their Prayers mingled with Hymns, which la≈øted very long: At the end, he that performed the Ceremony of the Marriage, went to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and read three or four Prayers, making over him the Sign of the Cro≈øs, before, and at the end of every Prayer. He cau≈øed him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to ≈øit on the ground, having his face turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the <hi>Heikel,</hi> holding behind him upon his Head, in a ≈øtanding po≈øture, a Silver Cro≈øs, and continuing in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Whiles this was doing in the Chancel, the Beadle cau≈øed the Bride, with one of her Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, to ≈øit down upon a Bench that he had there put out of the door of the uttermo≈øt Chancel. As ≈øoon as the Prie≈øts had ended in the innermo≈øt Chancel, the <hi>prayers of the Knot,</hi> as they name them. He that performed the Ceremony, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the Bridegroom with a Surplice, and tyed him about the middle with a Girdle, putting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head a white Cloth.</p>
                  <p>In this manner he led him to the Bride, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing him to ≈øit by her: He then covered them <pb n="205" facs="tcp:106091:106"/>both with this white Cloth, and made them put their heads together. Then he anointed the Bridegroom with Oyl-Olive in the Forehead, and above the Fi≈øt, and the Bride in the ≈øame manner: Afterwards he cau≈øed them to give one another their hands, reading aloud the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that contains the Duties which they were to perform to one another. So with a long train of Prayers, interrupted with ≈øeveral Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, this Solemnity of Marriage ended, which they call the
<hi>Coronation of the Married Couple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards they read Morning-prayer, or as we call them, the
<hi>Laudes.</hi> They ≈øung next Ma≈øs, where the Bridegroom and the Bride received the Communion; which being ended, they all returned to their ≈øeveral homes.</p>

                  <p>THE night of the 16th of <hi>January,</hi> 1673. the
<hi>Copties</hi> celebrate the Fe≈øtival of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphany.</hi> I was then at <hi>Cairo</hi> in the Church of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moncure,</hi> to ≈øee how they dip them≈øelves in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in remembrance of the Bapti≈øm of our Lord and Saviour, which was performed that night according to the Traditions of the Church. I took notice of the≈øe Particulars.</p>
                  <p>They ≈øaid the Prayers of Midnight, where the Font ≈øtands, and where they dipped them≈øelves, which they call <hi>il Magtas.</hi> This Pond, or Ba≈øon: of Water is in a Chamber near the Church, about three Perches ≈øquare, as deep as a Man is high. As ≈øoon as Prayers were ended, the Patriarch went to the <hi>Kolomie,</hi> or <hi>Ve≈øtry,</hi> to put on his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical <pb n="206" facs="tcp:106091:107"/>Attire; from thence he return'd to the Water, with a Deacon and a Prie≈øt before him. The Deacon had on him a Cape, bearing in his hand an Iron Cro≈øs, as long as a Pa≈øtoral Staff. The Prie≈øt was Cloathed with a Surplice, that he might be u≈øeful to the Patriarch in ≈øaying of Ma≈øs; that is, that he might be his a≈ø≈øi≈øtant, and Ma≈øter of the Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>When he was come to the Water, he began to ble≈øs it, by reading over it ≈øeveral Le≈ø≈øons taken out of the Prophets and the P≈øalms, and out of the New Te≈øtament; ≈øometimes in the <hi>Copties</hi> Language, ≈øometimes in <hi>Arabick.</hi> The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch perfum'd it al≈øo, and ≈øtirr'd it cro≈øs-wi≈øe with the Pa≈øtoral Staff of Iron, which the other Prie≈øts did al≈øo, every one in his turn. And whil≈øt they were ble≈ø≈øing this Water, which la≈øted near two hours, there was a Candle≈øtick of Iron ≈øtanding within, about the length of a Man, with three Branches, upon which there were three Tapers burning all the time of this Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as this ble≈ø≈øing was ended, the Pond, or Ba≈øon, was all uncovered, that the People might go in and dip them≈øelves. Then there was heard a ≈øtrange confu≈øion and noi≈øe, ≈øo great that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd; for every one endeavoured to be one of the three fir≈øt, whom the Patriarch dips in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They that could not obtain this honour, dipp'd them≈øelves, skipping and playing, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, in the Water, without having any thing to cover their nakedne≈øs, and privy Members; and all this in the pre≈øence of their Patriarch, and many Prie≈øts that were there.</p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as the Men had ended their wa≈øhing, and were gone to the Chancel; the Women, and <pb n="207" facs="tcp:106091:107"/>the Maids drew near, and followed the Mens Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, skipping all naked in the Water, and ≈øport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one with the other. It is true that ≈øuch as did thus dip them≈øelves were of the poorer ≈øort, and that as many as were of the wealthier, and better ≈øort, wa≈øh'd their faces and hands.</p>
                  <p>When the Women had ended their bathing, they went away to their own places to hear Ma≈øs, which was already begun.</p>
                  <p>Thus this Ceremony was performed, which I ≈øaw from the beginning to the end.</p>
                  <p>The 26th of this Month Mon≈øieur <hi>de Tyger,</hi> who had been, till then, Con≈øul of the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, left <hi>Cairo.</hi> He is a very able Man, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtands his duty very well; but the Merchants of <hi>France</hi> made their complaints again≈øt him at Court, and caus'd him to be di≈ømi≈øs'd.

                  <p>An infinite number of <hi>Schiechs,</hi> or Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticks, followed after in a confu≈øion, cau≈øing ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Banners to be carried before them, which had been taken out of the Mo≈øques of <hi>Cairo:</hi> Some were on foot, others riding upon A≈ø≈øes, and all cloathed in a very ≈øtrange manner, with Garbs made up with divers pieces of many colours patched together. They cau≈øed them≈øelves to be wondered at by their howling and grimaces, for they wagg'd their Heads, their Eyes, and their Mouths, in a thou≈øand ways; others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the word <hi>Hu,</hi> which is one of the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Names of God, with all the ≈øtrength of their body; and there was none without Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, a Club, or a Halberd, or a wooden Sword, or ≈øome other ru≈øty Weapon.</p>
                  <p>After this Crowd came the Cloth with which they cover

Eight and twenty <hi>Jani≈ø≈øaries</hi> went next, two and two, with their Caps upon their heads.

His Dome≈øticks, who were twelve Archers well cloathed, and a Troop of Mu≈øqueteers on Hor≈øes, waited upon him; after followed the Drummers, the Trumpeters, the Pipers, either on Hor≈øeback, or riding upon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels; and at la≈øt there was an Engine, drawn by the ≈øtrength of Men, upon which was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentented the Porch of the Temple of

                  <p>The Money needful to make all the≈øe Cloaths,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:106091:109"/>is taken out of the Revenues of the Lands which the ancient Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> have appointed for that purpo≈øe, which hath been confirmed by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours.

                  <p>That which was worthy of notice in this Pomp, was the blind Devotion of the≈øe Wretches for the things which are to be u≈øed by their Prophet, or employed in their Religion.

<hi>Nilus.</hi> At this place the Lands of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which are at the
<hi>Ea≈øt</hi> of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> begin to be manured, for from
<hi>Cairo</hi> to this place, they are all cover'd with Sand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> morning, the 28th of <hi>February,</hi> we left at the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> of <hi>Nilus</hi> two Ca≈øtles ruinated, near one another, and pa≈øs'd by the Mountain called <hi>Gebel-garanat,</hi> ≈øcituate on the ≈øame ≈øide, where the Territory of <hi>Egypt</hi> begins again to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful and ≈øandy.</p>
                  <p>A little before Noon we ≈øaw our ≈øelves over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt
<hi>Serarie,</hi> a Village on the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> but within the Land, ≈øeated at the foot of this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. In this place our Bark ran in the Sand, and when the Boat-men were not able to free her, the
<hi>Jani≈ø≈øaries</hi> that were with us forced all the other Travellers and Chri≈øtians with Cudgels to leap over into the water to help them.</p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as it was freed, we proceeded on in our way, and we began to di≈øcover the Caves of the Mountain which are at the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and a little after the Mount of Birds, called in
<hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick Gebel Teir,</hi> which is ≈øo equal from the top to the bottom about half a mile, that it looks like a ≈øtrait Wall, built by hand, rather than a Rock made thus by Nature, which is a very delightful ≈øight to Travellers. The water of <hi>Nilus</hi> wa≈øhes a great deal of it: On the top of this Mountain <pb n="215" facs="tcp:106091:111"/>is the Mona≈øtery of the
<hi>Copties,</hi> called <hi>Deir il bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,</hi> and a little further ≈øeveral Caves, and the ruines if an Ancient Town.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> night we were in ≈øight of <hi>Minie,</hi> but our Ve≈ø≈øel ran a-ground once more in the Banks of Sand, ≈øo that the Boat-men could not free it before night, and there it ≈øtopt till next day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> in the morning, whiles our Boat-men were bu≈øie in freeing the Boat, I went to ≈øee the City of <hi>Minie,</hi> ≈øcituate on the <hi>We≈øt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> belonging to the
<hi>Ca≈øcieflik</hi> of <hi>Behne≈øe.</hi> I went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo into the
<hi>Mo≈øques</hi> without fear, becau≈øe I was cloathed in a
<hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Habit. When our Boat-men had freed the Bark, they drew her up to <hi>Minie,</hi> for we ≈øail'd upwards; there I went on board to go towards <hi>Melave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About an hours ≈øailing from <hi>Minie,</hi> we began to di≈øcover on the top of the Mountain, which lies at the <hi>Ea≈øt,</hi> the Caves. This, in my judgment, is the beginning of the Country of
<hi>Thebes:</hi> They are to be ≈øeen along the Mountain, as far as
<hi>Momfallot;</hi> I counted four and thirty in a rank, but the Mouths of the Caves were ≈øtopped up with Earth that was fallen in.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øame day, about three a Clock in the Afternoon, we pa≈øs'd by the Ruines of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient City <hi>In≈øine,</hi> leaving it at our left hand, and at night we went to lie before <hi>Melave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ≈øailed away on <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> morning, the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>March,</hi> and we ≈øaw in our way many Caves in the Mountain, which is at the <hi>Ea≈øt.</hi> At Noon we left the great Channel of <hi>Nilus,</hi> becau≈øe there was but little water, and we enter'd into one of its Branches, which makes an I≈øland, by meeting again with the great Stream. We pa≈øs'd
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:106091:112"/>before the Mouth of the River of <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> of which I have ≈øpoken ≈øufficiently in the de≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friday</hi> morning, the third day of the month, we landed at <hi>Momfallot,</hi> where I lodged in an Hou≈øe called <hi>Ocalet Emir Otman,</hi> or the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Prince Otman,</hi> which is in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. It is an old dwelling much decayed, and though there is another more beautiful, and more commodious, I would not lodge in it, that I might not ≈øuffer the affronts of the <hi>Jam≈ø≈øaries</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hins,</hi> who lodg'd there, and who would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øulted over me, had they known me to be a

                     <hi>Momfallot,</hi> the abode of the <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, is a very great and beautiful Town of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> ≈øcituate upon the banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> on the <hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide, in the middle
<hi>Egypt.</hi> There is made much Linen-cloth: A great many Chri≈øtian
<hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> live here, but they have no Church.</p>
                  <p>The name of this Town ≈øignifies in <hi>Arabick</hi> the
<hi>Exile of Lot,</hi> becau≈øe a certain <hi>Lot</hi> was bani≈øh'd thither by his Brother, an ancient King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> as the <hi>Copties</hi> ≈øay. Over again≈øt, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> are the ≈øigns of an ancient Town, I could never under≈øtand the name.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Cairo</hi> to <hi>Bene≈øuef</hi> there are two days journeys by Land; and by water, ≈øometimes more, ≈øometimes le≈øs, according to the wind; from <hi>Bene≈øuef</hi> to <hi>Minie,</hi> are three days journeys by Land, from <hi>Minie</hi> to <hi>Melave</hi> is a little days journey, from <hi>Melave</hi> to <hi>Momfallot</hi> is a little more than a days journey, chiefly when the Hor≈øe is not good; and from <hi>Momfallot</hi> one may go and dine at <hi>Siut,</hi> if one takes the morning.</p>

                  <p>In the Province of <hi>Momfallot</hi> they reckon one and fifty Towns, ≈øix and thirty at the <hi>We≈øt</hi> ≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and fifteen at the <hi>Ea≈øt;</hi> which agrees not with the Relation of <hi>James Albert</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who reckons up two hundred and ≈øeventeen.

                  <p>The 7th day of this Month I went, about ≈øeven a Clock in the morning, for <hi>Siut,</hi> where I arrived about noon.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When I was arrived at <hi>Siut,</hi> I took two Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Hou≈øe called <hi>Occalet il hammam,</hi> or <hi>the Bathing-hou≈øe;</hi> ≈øo named, becau≈øe it is over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt a Publick Bathe; and though it be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it is plea≈øant and commodious.</p>
                  <p>A few days after, I craved acquaintance with the Bi≈øhop of the City, called <hi>Amba Joannes;</hi> he is a very hone≈øt Man, of a good life.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Siut,</hi> called in <hi>Greek Lycopolis,</hi> is one of the mo≈øt famous Towns of the Upper <hi>Egypt,</hi> ≈øcituate at the foot of a barren Mountain that ≈øtands on the <hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide, about half a league from <hi>Nilus.</hi> The Town is great and populous, full of Chri≈øtian

                     <hi>SAturday,</hi> the 18th of this Month, I went very early from <hi>Tahta,</hi> towards the famous Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery of S. <hi>Sennodius,</hi> ≈øirnamed the <hi>White,</hi> about a good days Journey from <hi>Tahta.</hi> The Bi≈øhop of <hi>Siut</hi> gave me one of his <hi>Arabians,</hi> named
<hi>Havaras,</hi> to guide me.</p>
                  <p>At the going out of the Town I met with a kind of a
<hi>Jani≈ø≈øary,</hi> called <hi>Seimen,</hi> who received no Sallary from the Grand Seignior, but lived by the orders of the <hi>Ca≈øciefs;</hi> he was ≈øitting in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, where we were to pa≈øs, his Mu≈øquet upon his ≈øhoulder, a Cutla≈øs at his ≈øide, and ready to march.</p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:106091:115"/>
                  <p>When we drew near him, he came to us, and ≈øtopt me bluntly, telling me that I mu≈øt alight. I was much ≈øurpri≈øed with this affront, and vexed that without cau≈øe I was to lo≈øe my Bea≈øt, I ≈øeem'd to be re≈øolved not to alight; we continued a pretty while to di≈øpute together, till I ≈øaw him lift up his Hatchet, which he wore at his Girdle, to cleave my head in two, and that my <hi>Arabian</hi> look'd idly upon us, as unconcern'd, I was forced to yield him my A≈øs; upon which he got imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and rode away.</p>
                  <p>I returned to the Town, on foot, to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop, who under≈øtanding my misfortune, cau≈øed another to be given me. I went on in my way, and at our going out of <hi>Tahta,</hi> we pa≈øs'd by the Ruines of the ancient Town of <hi>Beneviet;</hi> we le≈øt at our left hand other ≈øigns of an ancient Town, called <hi>Po≈øone;</hi> from thence we pa≈øs'd to
<hi>Sciendavil,</hi> a good Town, and at noon we got as far as
<hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zire,</hi> which is a Town where the <hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> of the Province lives; when we had a little re≈øted our ≈øelves in a Coffee-hou≈øe, we went on our way towards the Mona≈øtery, leaving the way of <hi>Sohaitg,</hi> which we had kept till then; we turned to the right hand, towards the Mountain which is on the <hi>We≈øt</hi> of the Town, we went by <hi>Itfu,</hi> an ancient Town, called by the <hi>Copties</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>; about noon we got to the Mona≈øtery, where we lodg'd at night.</p>
                  <p>The Mona≈øtery of S. <hi>Sennodius,</hi> the
<hi>Archiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drite,</hi> ≈øirnamed the <hi>White,</hi> is built near the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the ancient Town <hi>Adribe.</hi> There are the Remains of one of the mo≈øt Magnificent Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures that hath been in <hi>Egypt.</hi> It is four≈øquare; its Walls are builded with hewn Stones, very
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106091:116"/>white; every Stone is four foot long, and a foot and three inches high. It is ≈øeven and thirty Perches and two foot long, which make two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty four foot, and eighteen Perches and three foot broad, which make one hundred and eleven foot. There be ≈øix great Gates of a red Stone, which now are walled up, one only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which now hath an open place as high as a Man. The chief Gate that is walled up is now called <hi>Bab il bagl,</hi> or <hi>the Mules Gate,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what happen'd to a Daughter of an Heathen King, who offered to go into the Church in contempt, riding upon a Mule, and was ≈øwallowed up alive in a Pit that opened, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh her in≈øolency; which Miracle happen'd by the Prayers of S.
<hi>Sennodius,</hi> who begg'd this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment from God. This Gate is ten foot high, and ≈øix broad; every one of the Supporters is made up with four great Marble Stones, as well as the Lintil, upon which is graven three Cro≈ø≈øes, one great in the middle, and two little ones on the ≈øides.</p>
                  <p>Round about the Building are two ranks of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, the lowe≈øt are in the middle, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers almo≈øt touch the top. The two longe≈øt ≈øides of the Building have each ≈øeven and twenty Windows in each Rank, and the ≈øhorter ≈øides each have nine in each rank, but all the≈øe Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are walled up.</p>
                  <p>The in≈øide of this Mona≈øtery is demolli≈øhed, the
<hi>Heikel</hi> excepted, where Ma≈øs is ≈øaid, and the middle. The body of the Church, called by the <hi>Copties Giamelun,</hi> was heretofore ≈øupported with two ranks of Pillars, each having fourteen; which are yet ≈øtanding, but in the open Air; for the Vault is fallen down.</p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:106091:116"/>
                  <p>All the Pillars are not of the ≈øame Stone, nor Workman≈øhip, nor bigne≈øs, nor height; for ≈øome are rea≈øonably big, others are ≈ølenderer. And to ≈øuch as are ≈ømall, they have clapt ≈øome Plai≈øter, to make them as big as the others.</p>
                  <p>At the going in of the Chancel are to be ≈øeen two very beautiful Pillars of Marble, at the entry of the <hi>Heikel.</hi> Upon that which ≈øtands at the left hand is graven an Epitaph in <hi>Greek,</hi> of one named <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> The≈øe Pillars are yet entire, and their Workman≈øhip is very beautiful.</p>
                  <p>Almo≈øt every where in the Walls of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery, in the Pavement that is before the Chancel, and in the great and beautiful pair of Stairs that lead up to the Sleeping-place of the Monks, are certain great Stones full of Cyphers and Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick Figures placed not right; by which we may under≈øtand, that tho≈øe that have put them there had no knowledge of this my≈øterious Tongue. In the Walls within are ≈øix holes in each ≈øide, vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, and curiou≈øly adorned with carved Leaves, ≈øo hand≈øomly wrought that I could not ≈øufficiently admire the Workman≈øhip. Round about the Mona≈øtery there is much black Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>In one of the Apartments of the Mona≈øtery, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the
<hi>We≈øt,</hi> at the left hand as one goes in, there is a large and deep Well. The Monks told me that the Water was forty Cubits deep, and that it had been ≈øanctified, or ble≈øs'd, by our Saviour. It is very ≈øweet and whole≈øome, and ri≈øes and falls with <hi>Nilus,</hi> though it hath no communication with this River.</p>
                  <p>The next day in the morning, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> and the ninth day of the Month, after Ma≈øs, I went, <pb n="226" facs="tcp:106091:117"/>with my
<hi>Arabian,</hi> towards <hi>Red</hi> Mona≈øtery, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hours travelling from the <hi>White,</hi> at the foot of the ≈øame Mountain, towards
<hi>Tahta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The colour of the Bricks with which this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na≈øtery is built, hath given it the name of <hi>Red.</hi> It is built in the ≈øame manner as the
<hi>White,</hi> but a great deal le≈øs. At the <hi>South</hi>-≈øide it hath yet a Building ≈øtanding, that was cre≈øted, as the Monks ≈øay, by S.
<hi>Helene,</hi> when ≈øhe went to <hi>I≈øne</hi> to vi≈øit the bodies of the holy Martyrs. It was intended to inclo≈øe the Well of the Mona≈øtery within the Walls, and to hinder the <hi>Arabians,</hi> when they made in roads from their Mountains, from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Monks, or taking away from them the Water.</p>
                  <p>There remains nothing of this Church, but the Chancel, and the
<hi>Heikel,</hi> or place where Ma≈øs is read. The Pillars that kept up the body of the Church are yet ≈øtanding, all of an equal length and bigne≈øs. In this particular they excell tho≈øe of the <hi>White</hi> Mona≈øtery, as well as in the beauty of the Workman≈øhip, e≈øpecially their Capitals.</p>
                  <p>The Builders of this Mona≈øtery was <hi>Amba Bi≈øcioi,</hi> who having a long time liv'd as a Robber, as the Story of his Life ≈øaith, at la≈øt he repented and ended his days very well. Some told me, that the Club with which he us'd to knock down Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øengers is hung up in the Chancel of this Church. I ≈øaw it not, becau≈øe I was told of it after I was gone out of the Mona≈øtery.</p>
                  <p>There is a Pillar al≈øo at each ≈øide of the Door of the
<hi>Heikel,</hi> of an excellent Workman≈øhip, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their Capitals, which are the mo≈øt beautiful that I ever beheld.</p>
                  <p>But this Mona≈øtery, as well as the <hi>White,</hi> is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ruinated within.</p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:106091:117"/>
                  <p>When I had ≈øeen all that was worthy of notice, I return'd to
<hi>Tahta,</hi> where I arriv'd, about noon, the 21th of the month, and the next day we went to <hi>Siut.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A few days after, I went with the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Siut</hi> to the Mona≈øtery of S. <hi>Athana≈øius,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three hours travelling from thence, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied to ≈øee there ≈øome rare Reliques of Antiquity, but I was deceiv'd; for I ≈øaw that it was one of the mo≈øt woful Mona≈øteries in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ≈øo that I ≈øhall not mention it any more.</p>
                  <p>In our way to this Mona≈øtery, we ≈øaw that of the Virgin at
<hi>Doronque,</hi> ≈øcituate upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ≈øtands at the right hand.</p>
                  <p>This Mona≈øtery, with its Church, are cut in the Rock; which is the only thing there to be noted. All the re≈øt was ≈øo far from ≈øatisfying my Curio≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I beheld nothing but Ruines and mi≈øery.</p>
                  <p>But that I might not lo≈øe, altogether, my labour, in climbing up to the Mountain, I went to ≈øee the Caves that were near. My Guide led me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one as high as a Man on hor≈øeback, ≈øo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary large, that without hyperbole a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Hor≈øe might there draw up in Battel array, which cau≈øed me to wonder not a little.</p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon as we were out of this large Cave, my Guide led me into another hard by, larger than the former: when I was within about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces, he told me to hearken to a certain place of the Wall, at the left hand as one goes in. U≈øe no doubt had made him take notice of this place; for I ≈øaw no ≈øign outward to cau≈øe one to mind it. I drew near to li≈øten, and I heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Wall, the noi≈øe as of a Wind-mill, ≈øo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinct that I marvelled greatly, only the noi≈øe <pb n="228" facs="tcp:106091:118"/>≈øeem'd to come from far. I wonder'd the more, when he told me that behind this Rock there was no empty place, nor pa≈ø≈øage, for the Air to make this noi≈øe, which has continued during the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Man. All Per≈øons of whom I inquir'd for the cau≈øe of this Wonder, told me nothing el≈øe, but that it was a <hi>Tali≈øman,</hi> and that there was ≈øome hidden Trea≈øure.</p>
                  <p>A little further, towards the <hi>South,</hi> upon the ≈øame Mountain, are to be ≈øeen the Ruines of an ancient Mona≈øtery, dedicated to S. <hi>Severus,</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> whom the <hi>Copties</hi> reverence as a Saint, becau≈øe he maintain'd the Doctrine of
<hi>Dio≈øcorus</hi> their Patriarch, who≈øe opinions they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The Bi≈øhop of <hi>Siut</hi> told me, that heretofore three hundred and three≈øcore Monks inhabited in this Mona≈øtery, who employed them≈øelves in ≈øeeking for the Philo≈øopher Stone, and in the works of Chymi≈øtry; an excellent Employment for ≈øuch as have left the World, and for≈øaken their Riches.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE 26th of <hi>March</hi> I return'd to <hi>Momfallot,</hi> with an intent to take Boat for <hi>Girge,</hi> and continue my Travels farther. I enter'd into the Town about noon; as ≈øoon as I was in my former Lodging, a Man of my acquaintance gave me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the Chri≈øtians of that place, tho≈øe very Per≈øons to whom I had been recommended by their Patriarch, had accu≈øed me to the <hi>Ca≈øcief,</hi> and told him that I was a rich <hi>Franc,</hi> who made it my bu≈øine≈øs to run up and down the Land, to di≈øcover <pb n="229" facs="tcp:106091:118"/>where the Trea≈øures were hid, to inform the King of <hi>France,</hi> who intended to come and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Egypt.</hi> This Friend ≈øaid al≈øo that the <hi>Ca≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cief</hi> had commanded to take me, where ever I ≈øhould be found.</p>
                  <p>This wicked news made me think upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and at that time there was no conveniency to go by Water to <hi>Girge,</hi> and becau≈øe the
<hi>Ca≈øcief</hi> might have ≈øooner taken me on that ≈øide, his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction reaching a great way; I went back to <hi>Melave,</hi> becau≈øe his Dominion was but narrow thitherward. I took that way to return to
<hi>Cairo,</hi> the place of my ordinary abode, whither I went by Land; for I had been by Water before.</p>
                  <p>At our going out of <hi>Momfallot</hi> we went by <hi>Om il Co≈ø≈øur,</hi> a Village, where great Mountains of Ruines are to he ≈øeen. We left next at our left hand, the ≈øigns of the ancient Town
<hi>Co≈ø≈øie,</hi> which is called by the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors
<hi>Apollonopolis.</hi> We went by <hi>Sennabo</hi> next, which is a very good and populous Town. We ≈øaw <hi>Biblau, Bamib,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sun ≈øet we came to <hi>Tarut I≈ø≈øcerif,</hi> a great Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, where we were entertained <hi>gratis</hi> by an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian</hi> Lord, who keeps an Hou≈øe of Ho≈øpitality, called in that Tongue <hi>Beit diafe,</hi> to lodge Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that will ≈øtay there a night, with their Bea≈øts. He entertains them at his own charge.</p>
                  <p>The next day, the 28th of the Month, after that I had returned thanks to my Benefactor, I went ≈øtreight to <hi>Melave.</hi> At our going out of <hi>Tarut I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcerif,</hi> I went through the Channel of
<hi>Jo≈øeph</hi>'s Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on foot, for there it begins. I went next to
<hi>Tanuf,</hi> a Village, where ≈øome Ruines are yet to be ≈øeen; and about noon we were at <hi>Melave,</hi> where I lodged at the <hi>Occale,</hi> or Inn, that is near the <pb n="230" facs="tcp:106091:119"/>Market-place, at the
<hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide of the Town, near the great <hi>Mo≈øque;</hi> and becau≈øe the upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were all taken up by <hi>Turks,</hi> I was obliged to lodge in a very low Room, where I met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconveniences, becau≈øe it was near the Door, at the pa≈ø≈øage of all comers and goers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wedne≈øday,</hi> the 29th of the Month, the <hi>Turks</hi> begin the Fea≈øt called <hi>Eid il dehie,</hi> or <hi>the Ea≈øter of the Victims;</hi> for they u≈øe to kill Sheep during this Fe≈øtival, and give the Fle≈øh to the Poor for Gods ≈øake. This Fe≈øtival continues three days, during which time the <hi>Copties</hi> buy no Victuals from the
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> nor Bread, Wine, Fle≈øh, Coffee, nor Water. By this they di≈øcover their abhorrency of that Religion; for thereby they ≈øhun all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions of communicating with them.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Melave</hi> I got acquaintance with an Arch-Prie≈øt of that place, called <hi>Na≈ø≈ør alla.</hi> He was the hone≈øte≈øt, civile≈øt, and able≈øt Man that I ever knew of that Nation. There are about ≈øeven hundred <hi>Caraches,</hi> or Heads, that pay Tribute. They have there a Church, dedicaced to S. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> which is but little, poor, and ob≈øcure.</p>
                  <p>The River <hi>Nilus</hi> ≈øwallowed up heretofore the ancient
<hi>Melave,</hi> and now the River runs in the place where that Town ≈øtood. The Town now is built in another place, where was anciently a Wood that was a retreat for Robbers.</p>

                  <p>I Was loth to return to <hi>Cairo</hi> without ≈øeeing the Country of the Lower <hi>Thebes,</hi> or at lea≈øt a part of it, ≈øeeing that I was ≈øo near it; I re≈øolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore to follow the advice of my Friend,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106091:119"/>the Arch-Prie≈øt, and to go to the Mona≈øtery of
<hi>Abuhennis il Ke≈ø≈øir,</hi> or of S. <hi>John</hi> the little, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was Governour, ≈øcituate near the ancient Town <hi>In≈øine,</hi> on the
<hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> about an hours travelling from
<hi>Melave,</hi> to ≈øee the Rarities thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saturday,</hi> the fir≈øt of <hi>April,</hi> I went from
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lave</hi> to this Mona≈øtery; and the next day, being our
<hi>Ea≈øter-Sunday,</hi> I got a Guide to lead me upon the Mountain, which is behind, on the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide, to ≈øee the Caves of the ancient Hermites that are round about, and near to the Town, which have given to it the name of <hi>Thebes,</hi> as we ≈øhall ≈øee in the following di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
                  <p>I went into many of the≈øe Caves that were all very large. I ≈øaw nothing worthy of notice, but in ≈øome certain Cro≈ø≈øes graven in the Rock; and upon the Walls of one I ≈øaw two Angels, holding up with their hands a Cro≈øs in the Air.</p>
                  <p>The only thing that pleas'd me among the≈øe Caves, was a Mona≈øtery, with a Church, all cut in a firm Rock. The Vault of the Church was ≈ømooth, and the Paving very even. The Walls were painted in an antick fa≈øhion, with the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtories of the New Te≈øtament, with Images of Hermites, and Saints, who≈øe names were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten underneath in
<hi>Coptick</hi> Letters. At the end of the Church, <hi>Southward,</hi> I ≈øaw a Cro≈øs cut in the Rock, with a <hi>Greek</hi> In≈øcription, in ancient Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. And upon the Walls of another Cave, at a little di≈øtance from this Church, and higher, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the top of the Mountain, I ≈øound al≈øo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graven upon the Wall; and near this, two others, which are all Epitaphs of Abbots there Interr'd. I could not cau≈øe them to be put here,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106091:120"/>becau≈øe the Printer would not be at the charge of the Characters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> the third, being <hi>Monday</hi> in
<hi>Ea≈øter</hi> Week, I went to the ancient Town of <hi>In≈øine,</hi> called in the <hi>Copties</hi> Dictionaries <hi>Antinoe,</hi> and <hi>Thebes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went to ≈øee fir≈øt the Tomb of <hi>Mahomet Bey,</hi> a
<hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Girge,</hi> about fourteen years ago. When he took arms again≈øt <hi>Pacha Gaze,</hi> he was defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Melave,</hi> and his men for≈øook him; he was taken and ≈øtrangled. His Tomb is out of the City in the common burying place, and though there is nothing there extraordinary, I was de≈øirous to ≈øee it, becau≈øe he hath been, and is yet in great reputation among≈øt the Inhabitants for his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice and good Government, which hath cau≈øed him to be lamented by all the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>pper Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I had ≈øeen this Tomb, I walked into the Town, and the fir≈øt thing that I took notice of, as a great Antiquity, was the Pillar of
<hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> Its bottom is above five foot, the four uppermo≈øt are all even, and the fifth below is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with carved leaves. In the Ba≈øis is a <hi>Greek</hi> In≈øcription containing thirteen lines.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øaw near this Pillar the pieces of three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, very much re≈øembling this, but broken down; there was nothing of them ≈øtanding but the Ba≈øis of one.</p>
                  <p>From the Pillar I went to ≈øee the <hi>Arch of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,</hi> which is almo≈øt all ≈øtanding. I took a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to climb up to it by a little pair of Stairs winding up in the Wall of the Arch, containing fifty ≈øteps, or thereabouts. I re≈øted my ≈øelf at the greate≈øt Window which is upon the chief Vault, where I had the ≈øatisfaction to di≈øcover all its ruines, and the ≈øcituation of this Town, heretofore ≈øo famous.</p>

                  <p>This Arch is alone, and altogether ≈øeparated from the other Ruines, and about four paces from the River <hi>Nilus;</hi> but for want of an In≈øcription, none knows for whom, and by whom it hath been rais'd. It is not inrich'd with carved Works, as tho≈øe of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> neverthele≈øs it is one of the mo≈øt beautiful that I have ever ≈øeen.</p>
                  <p>One of its fronts hath eight and forty foot in breadth, and one of its ≈øides four and twenty. The great Vault in the middle, which is between two little ones, is about 16 foot broad, and each of the two little ones ≈øeven foot. The thickne≈øs of the Wall which is between the great and the little Vaults, which is but one ≈øtone, is of ≈øix foot and two inches: The thickne≈øs which is between the little Vault, and the outward Angle of the Arch, is of five foot: The front that looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Nilus,</hi> is on the
<hi>South-Ea≈øt</hi> ≈øide.</p>
                  <p>There is yet fourteen Pillars of Marble on the left hand of this Arch, in a ≈øtreight line towards the River; ≈øome of them have their Capitals, others have lo≈øt them; ≈øome are joyned to the Huts of ≈øome
<hi>Arabians</hi> that dwell there. On the ≈øame ≈øide, towards the Mona≈øtery of <hi>Abuhennis,</hi> are to be ≈øeen three beautiful Pillars of
<hi>Porphyry</hi> ≈øtanding; ≈øome of them have their tops; a fourth lies along the ground near by.</p>
                  <p>In the Mo≈øque of this Town is a <hi>Sciech,</hi> or
<hi>Saint,</hi> whom the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Sciech Abade,</hi> for whom they have a great Veneration, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to have been a
<hi>Mahometan;</hi> but they are much deceived, he was a Chri≈øtian, a Bi≈øhop of <hi>I≈øne,</hi> he ≈øuffered Martyrdom at <hi>I≈øne.</hi> They have called him <hi>Sciech Abade,</hi> by an error which the Sir-name of this Bi≈øhop hath cau≈øed. He was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <pb n="234" facs="tcp:106091:121"/>
                     <hi>Ammonius il Abed,</hi> or <hi>the devout Ammonius.</hi> The <hi>Arabians,</hi> through a mi≈øtake of the word <hi>Abed,</hi> making it a proper name, whereas it is but an appellative, have called him <hi>Sciech Abade.</hi> His Reliques are kept in the <hi>Heikel</hi> of this Church, which now is a Mo≈øque.</p>
                  <p>I went afterwards to take a view of a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Palace, called by the <hi>Arabians Abulkerun,</hi> or the <hi>horned Building,</hi> becau≈øe, as I think, the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that are before this Palace have Capitals, whereof the Angles are ≈øo great, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as ≈øo many Horns to the beholders, which the word <hi>Kern</hi> ≈øignifies. But when I had viewed ≈øo many old Reliques, I was ≈øo weary, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Mona≈øtery; and the rather, becau≈øe of the violent heat, with an intent to return ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, and examine all things more exactly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the fourth of <hi>April,</hi> I went with my ordinary Guide to ≈øee the <hi>Vadigamus,</hi> and the Caves that are there.
<hi>Vadigamus</hi> is a narrow Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, between two Mountains, which are as high as one another, and flat on the top. This Valley is like a Bugle, from whence I believe this Valley hath borrowed the name; for the word
<hi>Vadiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> ≈øignifies the Valley of the Bugle. At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it hath a large entrance, which an≈øwers to a great ≈øandy Plain, which is at one ≈øide of the Mona≈øtery of <hi>Abuhennis.</hi> It ≈øtretches it ≈øelf
<hi>Southwards,</hi> about half an hours travelling over: Afterwards it ri≈øeth by degrees to the top of the Mountains, where it unites and joyns them, and repre≈øents the bottom of a Sack.</p>
                  <p>On both ≈øides of the≈øe two Mountains that face one another, are two Ranks of Caves, each Rank containing fifty Caves, or thereabouts,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106091:121"/>which make one hundred Caves upon each Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I enter'd into ≈øome of them that were ≈øo high, that three long Pikes tyed to one another would not have reach'd to the top: They are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, but without order within, and uneven, and not perfectly ≈øquare.</p>
                  <p>I have wondered at the capricious de≈øigns of the Ancient
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> to make ≈øuch wide Caves ≈øo high, and ≈øo numerous, yielding ≈øo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to the Inhabitants, for they are made upon the ≈øteep Mountains of Sand, far from Towns and Water, digg'd in the dark and main Rocks. If I had not perus'd the Hi≈øtory of <hi>Said ibn Patrik,</hi> who ≈øaith, that the <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s, Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> imployed the
<hi>I≈øraelites</hi> in digging in the≈øe Mountains, I ≈øhould be of the opinion of the Country people, who believe that all the≈øe Caves have been made by Devils, who have been thereunto forced by Conjurers, this Art having been always much practis'd in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for one would think that it is not po≈ø≈øible for men to make them: and I dare ≈øay, that when a Traveller hath ≈øeen all the Curio≈øities of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if he hath not ≈øeen the≈øe Mountains and Caves of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Thebes,</hi> he hath ≈øeen nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the fifth of the Month, I went again to
<hi>In≈øine,</hi> to look upon its Ruines with more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actne≈øs, and chiefly upon the Pillars that ≈øtand before the <hi>Abulkerun,</hi> on the
<hi>North-we≈øt</hi> ≈øide.</p>
                  <p>There are in all four before the front of this Palace, which heretofore was very magnificent, but now there remains but little, incompa≈ø≈øed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the Ruines. Two of the≈øe Pillars are on the one ≈øide of the door, and two on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; three are yet ≈øtanding, only a third part of <pb n="236" facs="tcp:106091:122"/>the fourth appears: they are made of a certain white ≈øandy ≈øtone, which is taken out of the Mountains near this Town: they are hollow on the ≈øides, from the bottom to the middle, but the re≈øt upwards is ≈ømooth: the bottom or bulk is nigh thirteen foot about; their Capitals are of two pieces, ≈øeven foot in Diameter; every bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is of five pieces, and every piece is ≈øeven foot long.</p>
                  <p>There was behind this Palace, on the <hi>South-Ea≈øt</hi> ≈øide, four other Pillars of the ≈øame bigne≈øs, form, and ≈øub≈øtance; but they are overthrown. I could ≈øcarce di≈øcern where their Ba≈øis ≈øtood: the Pillar of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ≈øtands at the
<hi>North-We≈øt</hi> ≈øide of this old Palace.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øame day I went again to ≈øee the Pillar of <hi>Marcus Aurelius;</hi> its Ba≈øis is thirteen foot high, made up with eight ranks of ≈øtones; the fir≈øt and lowe≈øt is half in the ground, and half out; the ≈øecond is two foot high; the third a foot and eight inches; the fourth, fifth, and ≈øixth, upon which is the In≈øcription, each two foot and two inches; the ≈øeventh bends out; the eighth is the immediate Ba≈øis upon which the Pillar ≈øtands: This Ba≈øis is five foot long, and two foot and ten inches high; it is ≈øquare in the bottom, in the middle Octogone, or of eight Angles, and in the top Oval: upon this ≈øtone is the bottom of the Pillar, which is made up of five pieces; the lowermo≈øt is beautified with Oaken leaves car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ≈øtone; I have never ≈øeen the like el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, it is three foot and a half high; the four other pieces are of ≈øeven foot each, and three inches long; the Diameter of the Pillar is of three foot and ≈øeven inches; the Capital is of <pb n="237" facs="tcp:106091:122"/>one ≈øtone, three foot and an inch high; the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference is of ≈øeven foot; upon the Capital ≈øtands an unpoli≈øh'd ≈øtone, four foot and two inches long, and three foot high.</p>
                  <p>I perceived that in this Town heretofore there hath been two Streets more remarkable than the others; one begun at the <hi>Abulkerun,</hi> and ended at the four Pillars of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> ≈øtretching from
<hi>Ea≈øt</hi> to <hi>North.</hi> This Street was adorned with two ranks of Pillars, one rank in each ≈øide: the ≈øecond begins at the Arch of Triumph, which is at one end of the Town, at the <hi>South-Ea≈øt,</hi> drawing to the
<hi>North-Ea≈øt.</hi> The≈øe Streets are very long, large, ≈øtreight, and full of ruines of ≈øtately Palaces.</p>
                  <p>About three a Clock in the Afternoon, I went the third time to ≈øee the Mona≈øtery digg'd in the Rock, mentioned before. I have always taken a great delight to view it, becau≈øe the ≈øight of it moved my Devotion: It ≈øtands about half an hours travelling a-foot from the Mona≈øtery of
<hi>Abuhennis,</hi> where I was, and <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> from this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na≈øtery.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>In≈øine,</hi> as well as in the Caves of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains round about, are to be ≈øeen in the ground great Pots, in which the ancient Inhabitants of this Province kept their Wines: They have an Ear at each ≈øide, and are ≈øharp at the bottom, that they might be ≈øixed in the ground: my Guide found many, which he brought to me; but the Wine was dried within, and as black as Pitch: I have ≈øent two of them to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ≈øeventh of <hi>April,</hi> the <hi>Good-Friday</hi> of the
<hi>Copties,</hi> I went with my Guide to ≈øee the Caves that are near the Mona≈øtery of <hi>Amba Bi≈øcioi,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <pb n="238" facs="tcp:106091:123"/>a mile from the Convent, towards the <hi>South.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt remarkable thing that I ≈øaw, was the Hieroglyphick Cave, which the Country people commonly call the Church. I conceive this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtake proceeds from the Cro≈ø≈øes which are paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where within.</p>
                  <p>To go into this Cave, one mu≈øt pa≈øs through another before it. This was heretofore very beautiful and great, but now it is much decayed. The top is fallen down; there remains nothing but the two ≈øide-walls, full of Hieroglyphick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures graven in the Rock; ≈øome are great, others are little, others are of a moderate ≈øize, but all very clean in good order.</p>
                  <p>From thence is a pa≈ø≈øage into the Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Cave, which I believe was a Temple of the Heathens: It is ≈øquare, very ≈ømooth within, cut in the Rock, ≈øour Perches long, three Perches and one foot broad, and two Perches high: The door that leads into it is four foot and a half large. In this Cave, over again≈øt the door, is a hole in the Wall, of a Perch and a foot deep, and four foot broad, and a Perch and one foot and eight inches high. This Cave is full of Images in the Walls, and above, which repre≈øent their Sciences by Emblemes, and Hieroglyphick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, with very little Characters in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage round about. The colours of them are ≈øo beautiful and lively, that I could not but wonder how they could continue ≈øo fre≈øh, during ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages.</p>
                  <p>Be≈øides this great number of Characters there painted, are to be ≈øeen ≈øome lines of the ≈øame little Characters very clean carved in the Wall, <pb n="239" facs="tcp:106091:123"/>≈øome reaching from one end to the other, others from the top to the bottom. The≈øe Characters, and Figures, are ≈øo numerous, that they are not to be drawn by any in le≈øs than a Months time.</p>
                  <p>Under the≈øe two Caves there is a rank of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Rock, very even within, but they are without Figures, and le≈øs, and not ≈øo high as the former; for they are but ≈øix foot high. In the bottom of every Cave is a Well, ≈øquare, and deep in the Rock, into which one may go down by the means of holes, or ≈øteps, made on purpo≈øe in both ≈øides of every Well. And in the bottom of every Well is an Alley in the Rock, but becau≈øe the≈øe Alleys are durty and ob≈øcure, none of our Company would venture to go down. In the Walls of ≈øome of the≈øe Caves are ≈øquare holes, ≈øix foot deep, and two foot broad, about the bigne≈øs of a Coffin; which makes me believe that the
<hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> did put here their dead in the≈øe Caves.</p>
                  <p>A little farther, towards the <hi>South,</hi> is another large Cave. I ≈øaw on the left hand an Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Picture in the Wall, with thirteen lines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, of Characters cut in the Picture.</p>
                  <p>From this Cave, which is at the end of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, towards the <hi>South,</hi> we went back to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na≈øtery of <hi>Abuhennis;</hi> and in our way we ≈øaw all the Caves that are in order upon this Mountain, as far as the place where the <hi>Vadigamus</hi> begins. We ≈øaw no rarity, only ≈øome painted Cro≈ø≈øes, in red, roughly drawn; from whence we gathered, that heretofore they have ≈øerved as Churches.</p>
                  <p>By the differing Workman≈øhip of the≈øe Caves, one may ea≈øily di≈øtingui≈øh ≈øuch as have been made by the ancient
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> by the Chri≈øtians, and Anchorites that cau≈øed this Province to flouri≈øh; <pb n="240" facs="tcp:106091:124"/>for the former are very regular, out within, with much care, and ≈ømooth; but the others are rough, and irregular.</p>
                  <p>And becau≈øe the Country People think that there is no Cave without a rich Trea≈øure, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> have digg'd every where, and ≈øpoil'd al≈øo the Hieroglyphick Cave, which is named the Church. They have ≈øo much undermin'd the Walls that ≈øome of the top is fallen down, and the Rain hath ≈øpoiled ≈øome of the Emblems, and Characters that adorned the Wall. And, as if Time had not blotted out enough, they have put out the Eyes of the Images, and Figures, in a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh manner, natural to them. I was highly di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd to ≈øee this; for were it not for this bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, this beautiful Cave would have kept it ≈øelf<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> entire till now.</p>
                  <p>When we had ≈øtaid nine days in the Mona≈øtery of
<hi>Abuhennis,</hi> I return'd to <hi>Melave,</hi> the 8th of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril;</hi> from whence I went, the 15th of the ≈øame Month, to <hi>Minie,</hi> altering my fir≈øt de≈øign to go by Land; for I ≈øaw that it would be too painful, and too dangerous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Minie,</hi> in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Books called <hi>Miniet ibn cha≈ø≈øit,</hi> is an ancient, great, and beautiful Town, on the
<hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus.</hi> Its Antiquity appears by its old Buildings, by its ≈øtrait Streets, ≈øo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that two Men can ≈øcarce to a-brea≈øt. In this Town the <hi>Bardaques,</hi> or Water-pots, are made, which are highly e≈øteem'd at <hi>Cairo,</hi> for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhion, and property, to cool Water. They are made with a kind of Clay, taken about a days Journey from thence, on the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> in a place called
<hi>Sciech fadl,</hi> from the name of a religious <hi>Mahometan</hi> there Interr'd.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:106091:124"/>
                  <p>The 19th of this Month, I went aboard a Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel, bound for
<hi>Bene≈øuef;</hi> a good Wind carried us a great way in a little ≈øpace of time. At nine a Clock we were over again≈øt <hi>Gebel Teir,</hi> or <hi>the Mountain of Birds;</hi> ≈øo called, becau≈øe at a ≈øet day of the year, all the Birds round about meet in a place, where a <hi>Tali≈øman</hi> draws them together from all ≈øides, and cau≈øeth them to ≈øtay there one day; when they have continued there till night, they all fly away, one excepted, which remains there, the Bill fixed in the Rock, till the ≈øame day the next year; at which time it falls down, and another takes its place.</p>
                  <p>When we pa≈øs'd over again≈øt this Mountain, I ≈øaw on the top a Stone, which is called the Camel, becau≈øe, at a di≈øtance, it is like a Camel. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further in our way, we di≈øcover'd <hi>Taka,</hi> or the Window, or a great hole which Nature hath made in the Rock, like a Window; which ≈øerves as a pa≈ø≈øage for the Birds when they go to their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous whither the <hi>Tali≈øman</hi> draws them, as the People of the Country ≈øay, and their Hi≈øtorians affirm.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Moors</hi> are come to this Window, they u≈øe to ≈øay the Chapter of the <hi>Fatha,</hi> or fir≈øt Chapter of the
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> for the poor People, who live, as they ≈øay, in this part of the Mountain, as Bea≈øts, feeding upon nothing but raw Herbs. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner we went by <hi>Bene Mohammed il Kifur,</hi> a Village ≈øcituate on the
<hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again≈øt it is an old Mona≈øtery, ruinated; and a little further appear a great many Caves, upon the Mountain near by. After we had pa≈øs'd by an old Ca≈øtle de≈øtroyed, we went to lye at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemzar,</hi> a great Village, ≈øcituate on the
<hi>We≈øt</hi>-≈øide <pb n="242" facs="tcp:106091:125"/>of <hi>Nilus,</hi> this River having wa≈øh'd away almo≈øt half the Buildings.</p>
                  <p>We went from thence, <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> morning, the 20th of
<hi>April,</hi> with a <hi>South-Ea≈øt</hi> Wind, fit to carry us to
<hi>Bene≈øuef.</hi> It was yet in the morning when we ≈øailed before
<hi>Heggiar Selame,</hi> which is a Bank in the River <hi>Nilus.</hi> Over again≈øt it are the Ruines of an ancient Town, and the Tomb of a
<hi>Sciech,</hi> or Saint. About noon we were near the Ruines of another ancient Town, called <hi>Medinet Giahel,</hi> which ≈øtands at the
<hi>Ea≈øt</hi> of <hi>Nilus;</hi> there are to be ≈øeen yet ≈øeveral Remains of Hou≈øes, made up with Bricks dried in the Sun. Over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt it is
<hi>Feggen,</hi> a Village often mention'd in a Book called <hi>Sinaxar.</hi> After Dinner a ≈øtrong Wind aro≈øe, and forced us to ≈øtop at <hi>Bebe,</hi> a great Village which is near <hi>Bene≈øuef,</hi> where we found incamped a Troop of <hi>Arabians,</hi> called <hi>Ateijat,</hi> with whom I pa≈øs'd the re≈øt of the day in di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friday,</hi> the 21th of the Month, we arriv'd at
<hi>Bene≈øuef,</hi> where we continued till the next day; and on the 24th of the Month I returned to <hi>Caire,</hi> without ≈øeeing <hi>I≈øne,</hi> as I had an intent.</p>
                  <p>But that the Reader may know what rarities are to be ≈øeen in this Town, and round about, I have here added that which hath been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by Father <hi>Portais,</hi> a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> in the year 1668. according to the account given me by the Reverend Father <hi>Francis,</hi> his Brother, and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in his Travels.

                  <p>Half a mile from <hi>I≈øne</hi> is to be ≈øeen a Convent, which the <hi>Copties</hi> ≈øay hath been built by S. <hi>Helena,</hi> dedicated to the holy Martyrs of this Town, whom the Governour of

<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> is <hi>Arment,</hi> heretofore a great Town, but now for≈øaken and ruinated. They call it in <hi>Arabick Beled Mu≈øe,</hi> or
<hi>the Country of Mo≈øes,</hi> becau≈øe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> believe that
<hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was born here. <pb n="244" facs="tcp:106091:126"/>Here is under ground an ancient Temple.</p>
                  <p>Two leagues on this ≈øide of <hi>Tuot,</hi> are two Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages very famous; namely, <hi>Luxor,</hi> and <hi>Luxor il Kadim,</hi> or <hi>the old Luxor;</hi> they are about half a league from one another.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Luxor</hi> is to be ≈øeen the Remains of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and beautiful Temple of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in which are three≈øcore and eighteen Pillars of a prodigious bigne≈øs, chiefly fourteen, placed in rank, two and two; ≈øo big that ≈øix Men can ≈øcarce embrace them, but they are but ≈øix Perches high.</p>
                  <p>The bottom of this Temple is yet entire; here are ≈øeveral Chambers, and ≈øeparations, whereof the Walls are full, from the top to the bottom, of Figures roughly drawn, and Hieroglyphick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters carved over. Before the Door ≈øtands two Needles, ≈øquare, and very high and entire; ≈øo fre≈øh that one would think that the Workman hath newly fini≈øh'd them. They are on every ≈øide eight foot broad.</p>
                  <p>Near their Ba≈øis are two Statues of Women, of black Marble; and though they be half under ground, to the Girdle, they ≈øtand out as high as three Men.</p>
                  <p>Their bigne≈øs is an≈øwerable to their height; for there is twelve foot from one ≈øhoulder to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They have a ≈øtrange kind of covering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, with a Globe on the top. Their Faces are disfigur'd, the re≈øt is whole.</p>
                  <p>The de≈øcription of the Fronti≈øpiece of this Temple, is with the other Pictures.</p>
                  <p>At the old <hi>Luxor</hi> is a very ancient Palace. Its Ruines ≈øhew that it hath been very glorious. They ≈øay, that here dwelt one of the ancient Kings of <hi>Egypt.</hi> In the Walks of this Palace are to be ≈øeen
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106091:126"/>many <hi>Sphinxes,</hi> in ranks, on both ≈øides of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, two foot from one another, looking upon the Alley. They have every one, one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foot in length. This Palace hath four Walks, that an≈øwer to four Gates. In the fir≈øt are one hundred and twenty <hi>Sphinxes,</hi> three≈øcore in each ≈øide; and in the ≈øecond are one hundred and two, one and fifty in a≈øide. Every Walk is about the length of a place to play at
<hi>Mall.</hi> the Gates of the Palace are extraordinary high, made with the mo≈øt beautiful Stones in the World; one of the ≈øides of the Gate is ≈øix and twenty foot high. (I find in another Copy of this Relation, that it hath thirty ≈øix foot.) The Palace is ≈øo defaced, that there is no order, nor beauty, that appears; neverthele≈øs there are ≈øo many curious things in it, that no Man in a Month, can take a full view of them; for there is above a Million of Figures, roughly drawn; ≈øome are covered over, others appear with an open face. Here are al≈øo a great many Pillars; I counted, ≈øaith the Father, in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour three≈øcore, which are all ≈øo great, that five Men can ≈øcarce embrace one of them about.</p>
                  <p>In the Court of the Palace is a Ba≈øon garni≈øhed about with beautiful Stones, and full of a bitter VVater, which, as the People ≈øay, whitens Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen very well. I tried it, ≈øaith the Father, by dipping into it my Handkerchief, which kept above four days the ≈ømell of Soap. At one Front of the Palace are two Statues of a Giant, of one Stone, as white as Alaba≈øter. They have Swords by their ≈øides. In the middle of the Palace is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as high as three Men, not well polli≈øh'd, but well proportioned.</p>
                  <p>A league on this ≈øide there is an ancient Town,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106091:127"/>called <hi>Habu,</hi> where are to be ≈øeen many rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, chiefly <hi>Mommies.</hi> At a di≈øtance one may there di≈øcover two Statues; one of a Man, the other of a VVoman. The Country People call that
<hi>Sciama,</hi> and this <hi>Tama,</hi> They ≈øeem to be at lea≈øt as big as the <hi>Abulhon,</hi> or the <hi>Sphinx</hi> over again≈øt <hi>Cairo.</hi> Near this place is a Village, where is to be ≈øeen two Statues from the River
<hi>Nilus,</hi> ≈øo new that one would think the Workman had ju≈øt perfected them.</p>
                  <p>Thirteen leagues on this ≈øide of the old <hi>Luxor,</hi> is a Town named <hi>Neggade,</hi> where is a Bi≈øhop with about ≈øeventy Families of Chri≈øtian <hi>Copties.</hi> Here is yet three Mona≈øteries, one is called
<hi>Deir il Salib,</hi> or <hi>the Mona≈øtery of the holy Cro≈øs;</hi> the ≈øecond <hi>Deir il Megma;</hi> the third <hi>Deir Mary Poctor;</hi> but the≈øe two la≈øt are not inhabited.</p>
                  <p>Two miles from <hi>Neggade,</hi> on the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi>-≈øide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> is the ancient Town of <hi>Kus;</hi> but here are but three≈øcore Chri≈øtian <hi>Copties,</hi> who have here a Church, dedicated to S. <hi>Stephen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Six leagues from <hi>Neggade,</hi> on this ≈øide, is
<hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> a Village ≈øcituate on the <hi>Ea≈øtern</hi> Bank of
<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> It is a Mart-Town, and the Rendezvous of the <hi>Caravans</hi> that go from <hi>Cairo</hi> to <hi>Co≈ø≈øeir,</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named
<hi>Berenice,</hi> four days Journies from this Village, and a Haven of the
<hi>Red-Sea.</hi> The Chri≈øtians that live at <hi>Kenne</hi> are very poor, and without any Church.</p>
                  <p>Two leagues on this ≈øide of <hi>Kenne</hi> is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Town of <hi>Tentiris,</hi> now called <hi>Dendera,</hi> where is a wonderful Temple of the ancient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of a prodigious bigne≈øs and height. It is to be ≈øeen at two leagues di≈øtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Macrizi</hi> ≈øaith, that it hath as many Windows
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106091:127"/>as there are days in the year: They are ≈øo plac'd, that every one an≈øwers to a degree of the <hi>Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack;</hi> ≈øo that the Sun ri≈øing in a differing degree every day of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> it ≈øends in its Beams into a di≈øtinct Window from the day before: And when at the end of the year it hath fini≈øh'd and run through every degree of the
<hi>Zodiack,</hi> it hath al≈øo from the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> ca≈øt in its Beams into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Window of this Temple: For this cau≈øe it is look'd upon as a Wonder in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ten Leagues on this ≈øide of <hi>Dendera,</hi> at the
<hi>We≈øt</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> is <hi>Ca≈ø≈ør,</hi> a Village where is an old Convent, dedicated to <hi>Amba Balamon:</hi> Over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt this Village is the ancient Town <hi>Hu,</hi> where is yet a Convent dedicated to S.
<hi>Menna,</hi> but there was then no Prie≈øt.</p>
                  <p>Two Leagues on this ≈øide of <hi>Hu,</hi> on the ≈øame Bank is
<hi>Bahgiura,</hi> at a little di≈øtance from the River: Its Port is called
<hi>Sahel;</hi> there is two Convents, one dedicated to S. <hi>Bidabe,</hi> the other to S. <hi>George.</hi> At two Leagues on this ≈øide of
<hi>Bahgiura,</hi> on the ≈øame Bank, is the Village <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liene,</hi> where is a very beautiful Church under ground, dedicated to the Ble≈ø≈øed Virgin.
<hi>Girge,</hi> the chief Town of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>pper Egypt,</hi> ≈øtands ≈øix Leagues from <hi>Beliene</hi> on this ≈øide.</p>
                  <p>Here ends the Relation of Father <hi>Portais.</hi> I could wi≈øh that this good man had given us a more exact account, and more at large of the Rarities that he ≈øaw in the≈øe places, for this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is ≈øuperficial.</p>
                  <p>The 14th of <hi>June,</hi> I went at <hi>Cairo</hi> to ≈øee the
<hi>Inchanted watering place,</hi> called in <hi>Arabick, Houd il mera≈ø≈øet,</hi> which is under the Mo≈øque of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106091:128"/>called <hi>Kalet it Keb≈øch,</hi> no Taveller hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øpoken of it.</p>
                  <p>It is a black Marble-≈øtone, made like a Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, ≈øeven foot long, ari≈øing out of the ground about a foot and a half: The ≈øides, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, are adorned with little Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick Letters, as well as the Brims. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Cairo</hi> ≈øay, that in the time of the ancient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the ≈øick people did recover their health by drinking Water out of it; and that by the virtue of a <hi>Ra≈ø≈øem,</hi> or Charm, which the Prie≈øts of <hi>Egypt</hi> had given to it.</p>
                  <p>The 20th of this Month I went to ≈øee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Well which is in the Ca≈øtle, commonly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi>'s <hi>Well.</hi> Its top is ≈øquare, very large, cut in the Rock; it is about one hundred and twenty Perches deep, the Perch containing ≈øix foot. The water is drawn out with two Wheels, the one plac'd at the Mouth of the Well, and the other about three≈øcore and fifteen Perches under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. There are two Oxen at each Wheel to turn them; the lowe≈øt, which is fifty Perches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the water, ≈øerves to draw the water into a Ba≈øon there on purpo≈øe; and from thence, the upper Wheel draws the water to the top. The Bea≈øts that work there, go up and down very commodiou≈øly by a great large Path, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the light through Windows cut on that ≈øide which looks to the water.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabian</hi> Authors call it <hi>Bir haleizun,</hi> or the <hi>Snails Well,</hi> becau≈øe there is a Path-way that winds round about. The people commonly ≈øay, that it was digg'd by Spirits; I am almo≈øt incline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe it, for I cannot conceive how men can compa≈øs ≈øo wonderful a work.</p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:106091:128"/>
                  <p>The Waters, as the Guardian told me, come out of the firm Rock, and yet increa≈øe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe as the River <hi>Nilus:</hi> But I have heard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ≈øay, that they come out of the great <hi>Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> which is in old <hi>Cairo.</hi> Becau≈øe I could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand the truth of it, I wi≈øh that ≈øome other Traveller would inform him≈øelf better.</p>
                  <p>They that think that <hi>Jo≈øeph, Jacob</hi>'s Son, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed it to be digged, are deceived, for the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Cairo</hi> was built many Ages after <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi>'s death; and it is the common opinion of all the <hi>Arabian</hi> Authors, that <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> dwelt at <hi>Memphis,</hi> which was on the other ≈øide of the River, near the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namids,</hi> and not on this ≈øide where <hi>Cairo</hi> ≈øtands.</p>
                  <p>The 9th of this Month they cryed about Town <hi>Ouf alla,</hi> that the River was ri≈øen ≈øixteen Cubits high. The next day, being S.
<hi>Laurences</hi> day, they cut through the <hi>Calitz</hi> with Ceremony; but there was no great rejoycings, becau≈øe the <hi>Pacha</hi> had ob≈øerv'd that before, and every <hi>Pacha</hi> performs it but once in his time.</p>
                  <p>On the 18th of the ≈øame Month there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a mi≈øchance to a <hi>French</hi> Merchant, which di≈øcovers the wonderful jealou≈øie of the
<hi>Turks.</hi> As this Merchant was taking the air at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his hou≈øe in the Even, on the <hi>Calitz</hi> ≈øide, a <hi>Jani≈ø≈øary</hi> that lived over again≈øt him, thinking that he made ≈øigns to his Women and Slaves, ≈øhot off a Pi≈øtol at him, and wounded him in the hand. The <hi>French</hi> Con≈øul could never obtain from the Ju≈øtice of <hi>Cairo</hi> to cau≈øe this Villain to be puni≈øh'd.</p>
                  <p>On the fir≈øt of <hi>September,</hi> Mon≈øieur <hi>de Bonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor≈øe,</hi> before Con≈øul of <hi>Seyda,</hi> ≈øucceeded to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur <pb n="250" facs="tcp:106091:129"/>
                     <hi>de Tyger,</hi> before Con≈øul at
<hi>Cairo,</hi> and landed at <hi>Boulac,</hi> in the company of many great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, upon a great Bark well trim'd, with a Flag of the Arms of
<hi>France</hi> on the Main Ma≈øt.</p>
                  <p>At his arrival he ≈øaluted <hi>Boulac</hi> with five lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bra≈øs-Pieces of Canon, which were at the Stern of his Ship. He landed not at the <hi>Douane,</hi> for the Con≈øuls are free from that Vi≈øit, but in a plea≈øant hou≈øe upon the River, near the <hi>Douane,</hi> until he had got leave from the <hi>Pacha</hi> to go to <hi>Cairo.</hi> As ≈øoon as he had received it, he mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Hor≈øeback without more ado, and rode in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, with all the Merchants of his Nation riding on A≈ø≈øes. The
<hi>Pacha</hi> ≈øent none to bid him welcome; only the <hi>Venetian</hi> Con≈øul ≈øent his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to meet him, and his Hor≈øe.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øame day, one of tho≈øe Swimmers, whom I have already mentioned, ≈øwum all along the <hi>Calitz,</hi> according to the Cu≈øtom.</p>
                  <p>On the ≈øeventh of the Month, <hi>Ibrahim Pacha</hi> went from
<hi>Cairo</hi> in Pomp.</p>
                  <p>On the 29th, I went with Mon≈øieur <hi>Bonnecor≈øe</hi> to
<hi>Adelia,</hi> a Suburb of <hi>Cairo,</hi> on the <hi>North-Ea≈øt</hi> ≈øide, where are the Tombs of the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ≈øee the coming in of the new <hi>Pacha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not ami≈øs to mention here two Cu≈øtoms, which all the
<hi>Pacha</hi>'s ought to ob≈øerve when they come fir≈øt to this Government, and when they leave it.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Pacha,</hi> before he enters into <hi>Cairo,</hi> is bound to vi≈øit the Tomb of <hi>Sciech il Sciafei,</hi> who is buried in the
<hi>Caraffe,</hi> for he is the Protector of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family; for the <hi>Turks</hi> following the Doctrines of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, believe <pb n="251" facs="tcp:106091:129"/>that he is able to obtain for them from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, a happy and peaceable Government: And when they depart, they are bound to render the ≈øame re≈øpects to the Tomb of <hi>Sultan Cajed Bey,</hi> though an Enemy of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Race, and one of the la≈øt lawful Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to thank him, becau≈øe he had ≈øuffered his Government to be without di≈øorders and di≈øgrace.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe two Cu≈øtoms are ≈øo Religiou≈øly to be ob≈øerved by the <hi>Pacha</hi>'s that the people of <hi>Cairo</hi> ≈øay, that they have ≈øeen ≈øome that have neglected or contemned them, to have been ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly depo≈øed, and to have met with unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in their time.</p>
                  <p>I have heard ≈øay, that when <hi>Sultan Selimus</hi> had overcome the <hi>Mamelucs,</hi> he was afraid to go into <hi>Cairo,</hi> to take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of his Conque≈øt, till <hi>Sciech il Sciafei</hi> appeared to him, to a≈ø≈øure him, that he need not fear any thing. And that the next day when he made his Entry, an unknown per≈øon led his Hor≈øe by the Bridle into the Town, and then vani≈øh'd away.</p>
                  <p>When I had continued in ≈øo incommodious a City, as
<hi>Cairo</hi> is to the <hi>Francs,</hi> twenty Months, the fear of ≈øome mi≈øhap which might have befallen me if the <hi>Turks</hi> had known that I bought up their Books, cau≈øed me to think upon my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and to ≈øecure my ≈øelf, I imagin'd <hi>Con≈øtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> to be the mo≈øt fit for my purpo≈øe. I re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therefore to go thither: I left <hi>Cairo</hi> the
12th of <hi>October,</hi> 1673. to ≈øail to <hi>Ro≈øetta;</hi> and becau≈øe the River was then fulle≈øt, a good Wind and a ≈øtrong Current carried us thither in two Nights and a day. From thence, I went aboard the ≈øame
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:106091:130"/>day in a Ve≈ø≈øel of a <hi>Greek</hi> bound for
<hi>Con≈øtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> I landed at <hi>Chio,</hi> an I≈øland of the
<hi>Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lague,</hi> the 25th of <hi>November,</hi> where I ≈øtaid two Months and a few days, wondering at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light≈øomne≈øs of this I≈øland, and at the Civility of the Inhabitants to Strangers: I went to vi≈øit tho famous Mona≈øtery of the Religious <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Neamoni,</hi> or of the <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed and Only Virgin:</hi> I ≈øaw the Library, and all the other Rarities of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øland. From thence I went to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the
27th of <hi>January,</hi> 1674. where I arrived the ≈øecond of
<hi>February,</hi> and ≈øtaid till the 13th of <hi>March.</hi> Then I went aboard with Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Emba≈ø≈øadour of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> where I arrived the 24th of
<hi>March,</hi> being <hi>Holy Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 24th of <hi>July</hi> I went from <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> to the City <hi>Brou≈ø≈øe,</hi> called by the <hi>Europeans Bur≈øia,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and the ancient Seat of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours, to ≈øee the Hot Baths, the Tombs, and the ≈øtately Mo≈øques of the≈øe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours: I ≈øtaid there about eight days. On the fourth of <hi>September</hi> I went to the I≈øle of <hi>Chio</hi> the ≈øecond time, to ≈øee the gathering up of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtick,</hi> a ≈øweet Gum, which begins the 14th of this Month, according to the <hi>Greek</hi> computation; and the 28th of <hi>October</hi> I returned to
<hi>Con≈øtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the ≈øecond of <hi>January,</hi> 1676. the day that I was to depart with the <hi>Caravan</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> that I might return the third time to <hi>Cairo,</hi> I found my ≈øelf oblig'd to go back for
<hi>France;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there was then no <hi>French</hi> Ships in that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bound for <hi>France,</hi> only a ≈ømall Bark loaden
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106091:130"/>and bound for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which was gone out of the Haven to wait for a good wind at the I≈ølands near by. I went aboard that Ve≈ø≈øel, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leave her at the fir≈øt Port of the
<hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelague,</hi> where I might find ≈øome <hi>French</hi> Ve≈ø≈øel bound for <hi>France.</hi> I found one according to my de≈øire; for a furious Storm forced us to run into <hi>Suda,</hi> in the I≈øland of <hi>Candy.</hi> The 18th of this Month, I had news from the <hi>French</hi> Con≈øul of
<hi>Canea,</hi> that there was a Ve≈ø≈øel of <hi>Provence</hi> ready to ≈øet Sail for <hi>Thoulon;</hi> I left therefore my Bark, to ride to <hi>Canea,</hi> in the company of many Per≈øons on Hor≈øeback, whom the Con≈øul ≈øent to meet me. The 24th we ≈øet fail for <hi>Milo,</hi> where we arrived the 26th day of the Month: There we ≈øtopt eight days. The 20th of <hi>February</hi> we landed at <hi>Genoa,</hi> where we ≈øtaid one day; and the 24th of this Month we arrived happily at <hi>Thoulon,</hi> and the 22th of <hi>April</hi> I returned to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> after five full years Travelling.</p>
